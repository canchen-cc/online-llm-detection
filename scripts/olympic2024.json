The City of Lights became a sports stadium on the night of the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony on Friday (26 July), the River Seine \u2013 its track, the quays \u2013 spectator stands, and the historic landmarks along the way \u2013 silent witnesses to the vibrant celebration full of flags, feathers and raindrops. By taking the ceremony outside its traditional stadium setting for the first time in Olympic Games history, Paris 2024 invited everyone to take part in the four-hour extravaganza, created by artistic director Thomas Jolly. Athletes jumped on boat decks in pouring rain, spectators lined the quays and bridges, ballet dancers performed pirouettes on rooftops and Parisians stepped out onto their balconies to cheer on delegations from 205 National Olympic Committees (NOC). The river parade and artistic performances weaved through the heart of Paris towards the Trocadero where the world came together to hear the magic words from French President Emmanuel Macron: \"I declare the Paris Olympic Games open\". \"Some may say, we in the Olympic world, we are dreamers. But we are not the only ones,\" said International Olympic Commitee President Thomas Bach. \"And our dream is coming true tonight: a reality for everyone to see. Olympians from all around the globe, showing us what greatness we humans are capable of. So I invite everybody: dream with us. Like the Olympic athletes, be inspired with the joy that only sport can give us. Let us celebrate this Olympic spirit of living life in peace, as the one and only humankind, united in all our diversity.\"",

For an artist like no other, this is an opening ceremony like no other. Instead of the confines of a stadium, 6,800 attending athletes boarded 85 boats and took to the River Seine for a 6km winding parade, east to west, to take in iconic Parisian landmarks-turned-Olympic-venues such as the Eiffel Tower and Esplanade des Invalides. The American icon emerged from behind said feathers down steps on the riverbank to roars of surprise from the lucky fans who were able to secure some of the free tickets available for the general public to attend on docks along the way. Many a traditional wrought-iron balcony was also filled with lucky Parisians, too, as the athletes progressed along the river to their final destination, the Trocadero, and the official lighting of the Olympic Flame and official delegations to welcome the world to the XXXIII Olympiad. Lady Gaga embodied the cabaret and music-hall style that originated in France with her performance of 'Mon truc en Plume,' with her version of the song from iconic French revue artist Zizi Jeanmarie. \"Bonsoir! Bienvenue \u00e0 Paris!\" shouted Lady Gaga. Indeed. Let the Games begin.",

My three swims prior to this, I kept feeling that the time was a lot slower than it felt. That was the first one that felt like it showed in the time. I\u2019m really happy,\u201d Ledecky said after the race. \u201cI just wanted to swim a time I could be really happy with, and that was the one. It\u2019s never easy to win a gold medal. Just trying to soak in every moment of it.\u201d Within the first 300m, Ledecky was already a body length in front of her competitors. The race was tighter for the second and third steps on the podium. France\u2019s Anastasiia Kirpichnikova took the silver in 15:40.35, while Isabel Gose of Germany won the bronze. With the win, Ledecky now has 12 Olympic medals, including eight gold, to tie American great Jenny Thompson. This was a back-to-back win, as Ledecky won gold at Tokyo 2020 as well, and holds both the world and Olympic records in the 1500m. She won a bronze earlier in the week in the 400m freestyle and will swim again in the 800m freestyle. Ledecky smashed her old Olympic record from Tokyo 2020 by more than seven seconds. In her fourth Olympics, and at age 27, she continues to improve. \u201cI try not to think about history very much. I know those names, those people I\u2019m up with. They\u2019re people I looked up to when I first started swimming, so it\u2019s an honour to be named among them. I\u2019m grateful for them inspiring me. There are so many great swimmers that have helped me get to this moment,\u201d she said. Like so many French swimmers, Kirpichnikova had the loud crowd on her side. She said how much that meant to her. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. Everyone was screaming when I finished second. I still can\u2019t imagine it.

Boorman is detailing that experience in her upcoming book The Balance: My Years Coaching Simone Biles, due out 15 April. \u201cShe had said that her brother taught her how to do a back handspring in their backyard, but she had never had any formal gymnastics training. \u201cIn those early years,\u201d continued Boorman, \u201cshe would just watch people do skills and go and try them. For example, she had seen a cheerleader doing a back tuck in her practice one day and she said, \u2018I can do that,\u2019 but she had never done one before. \u201cShe stood up, and she did it just by watching,\u201d she concluded. It wasn\u2019t always that simple, though. As Biles progressed through the ranks and the skills became more difficult, Boorman used the same techniques to teach the now eight-time Olympic medallist as she would any other student. Biles helped Team USA to its fourth-ever Olympic team title Tuesday (30 July) at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. \u201cIn the early years, it was definitely just more of a visual thing for her,\u201d explained Boorman. \u201cWhen she started learning the really difficult skills, we broke them down just like would for any athlete. So, she had the drills in there, it just took her less time than the average person to put all the pieces together. \u201cShe was able to figure it out faster.\u201d",

An incredible moment followed as the competitors looked up at the clock to see Pan\u2019s time and began applauding. Pan\u2019s new mark lowered his previous record, which he had set at the 2024 World Championships in the 4x100m freestyle relay, by a full four-tenths of a second. His gold-medal victory also represents a first-ever medal for China in the 100m freestyle.

I\u2019ve never seen a win of that margin in that race in my career. And to go 46.4 - that\u2019s unheard of!\u201d Considering Pan\u2019s record in the context of where the men\u2019s 100m freestyle could be headed, Phelps added: \u201cTo be that much closer to going 45 seconds in a 100 freestyle, I can\u2019t understand that, I really can\u2019t.\u201d This is the second medal in Paris for Chalmers, who also won silver in the 4x100m freestyle relay. The 26-year-old, three-time Olympian said: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of myself that I was able to deliver another great performance and be on the podium again.\u201d \u201cSeeing a 46.4-second 100 freestyle swam next to me, the goalpost has definitely been shifted that I\u2019m going to train harder than ever if I want to be competitive.\u201d This also marks a second medal for Popovici following his gold-medal victory in the men\u2019s 200m freestyle. Popovici said: \u201cIt feels great having all the country watching and, having written history two days ago, to do it today again, I love it. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be here to be able to do this. And I do it for the country. I do it for the people watching, for everyone supporting me but, at the end of the day, I do it for me, for the 10-year-old me who dreamed a lot about this.

Back in Ethiopia, years before she moved to the Netherlands as a 15-year-old, a friend challenged her to compete in a race. Reluctantly, Hassan accepted the challenge and the first signs of this determined character began to reveal themselves. \u201cI remember running from 100 metres to 800 metres [end everything in between] until I won,\u201d explained the athlete with her customary laugh in an exclusive interview with Olympics.com. After beginning a new life in the Netherlands as a teenager, Hassan returned to the sport of athletics and that dogged determination continued to emerge - even in her very first training session. \u201cI went for so long that my leg was bleeding,\u201d she remembers. Hassan\u2019s determination has led her to take on some of the biggest challenges in her sport. She ran the 1500m, 5000m and 10,000m treble at the last Olympics in Tokyo, with two shining golds and a bronze the rewards for her audacious efforts. Just two years later, she competed in - and won - her debut marathon in London, following it up with victory in the Chicago Marathon just weeks after competing on the track at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest. Now, at Paris 2024, she has set herself her most ambitious challenge yet: the 5000m, 10,000m and marathon treble. While determination may have been the driving force behind all of these challenges, it is the times she has fallen down - both literally and figuratively - that have made her into the person she is today.",

        "document": "The Paris 2024 Olympics has been a memorable one for Ariarne Titmus. The Australian swimmer won the gold medal in women\u2019s 400m freestyle while settling for silvers in the 200m and 800m fly. She was also part of the Dolphins squad which won the 4x200m freestyle relay with an Olympic record-breaking time. Titmus\u2019 battle with American rival Katie Ledecky in the pool was, perhaps, one of the big highlights of the swimming competitions at Paris 2024. The two faced off in the 400m and 800m fly events. While it was Titmus who came out in the battle for the 400m title, Ledecky claimed bronze. In the 800m, though, it was the American ace who came out on top rendering the Dolphin\u2019s new personal best and Oceania record-setting time only good for a silver. In the 200m, compatriot Mollie O\u2019Callaghan set a new Olympic record to keep Titmus from defending her crown. After the 800m final, Titmus spoke about her campaign in Paris and the tussles with Ledecky, who she feels has made her into a better swimmer. Here are the excerpts: On her performance. Ariarne Titmus: I'm so happy to do a (personal best). This is the toughest week of racing you can possibly do. I've been feeling it at the back end of this week, and I gave it everything. I said to myself I wouldn't sleep at night if I felt like I left anything out there, so I'm so proud of my efforts. On Katie Ledecky. Ariarne Titmus: I felt like I took it to her. I challenged her. I made it a great race and I gave it everything. She just had an extra bit in the legs at the end. She's an absolute champion. I know how hard it is to defend a title. It's so much harder to win it a second time, and to be on top for over 12 years is unbelievable. I said to her after the race, she's made me a better athlete, I totally respect what she has done in this sport, more than anyone else. She's been winning this race since I was 11 years old, and I turn 24 next month. That is just remarkable. She's unreal. On the physical and mental toll of the Olympic Games. Ariarne Titmus: I knew what to expect physically and emotionally coming into this from learning from the last Olympics. Emotionally, this week, I had so much expectation on me the past few years to go back-to-back and continue my winning streak internationally, the 400 especially. You kind of put that in a little box and put it in the corner and don't really recognise it. I am so good at putting that pressure in a little pile and using it to my advantage to race, but then when it's off your back, somehow that creeps out and just explodes, and I'm feeling the most unbelievable sense of relief now that I'm done. I'm so proud of my efforts this week. Two gold, two silver. Couldn't defend my 200, but certainly happy that it was my training partner that won and to be second to her is great. I'm just so happy with my weekend. I can't wait for a big rest.",

Vijayveer Sidhu came the closest to making the final in the men\u2019s 25m pistol event, finishing ninth after scoring 583 and 26 inner 10s (Xs) over two stages. The top six shooters from the field of 29 made it to Monday\u2019s final. Sidhu was in contention to make the final before the last series. He shot 100/100 in the eight-second series of the second stage and 98/100 in the six-second series but a 47/50 and a 45/50 from the four-second series pushed him to the ninth spot. The cut-off for making the final was 585. Anish Bhanwala, also in contention at one stage, managed 46/50 on his final series to finish on 582-22X over two stages.

Meanwhile, India's skeet shooters Maheshwari Chauhan and Raiza Dhillon finished 14th and 23rd, respectively, from the field of 29. Only the top six qualified for the final. Chauhan shot a perfect 25 in the fourth round and was well-placed to reach the final. However, a 22/25 in the final round saw her slip to the 14th spot and end with a final score of 118/125. Dhillon shot 113/125 for 23rd place. The cut-off for the final was 120.

She is Algeria's sixth ever Olympic champion. \"I am very happy to have won this medal for Algeria. I hope I made them proud,\" she said. \"It's true that the pressure was very high the last days, but I managed to stay calm and focused. I was able to perform my routine (well) today.\" A year ago, Nemour made history for her nation as she won world silver on the event. It was the first medal by an African gymnast at the World Gymnastics Championships. Her 2024 season has been brilliant, with World Cup wins and massive 15.500 or higher scores in Cottbus, Doha and Baku. Those performances marked the 17-year-old as a favourite for gold in Paris. Nemour was overcome with emotion as soon as her feet hit the mat on her stuck double layout dismount. Qiu embraced her as the score came up, with Lee coming over to congratulate the Algerian. \"Everyone did incredible. It was super cool to just see them because I think only we can really understand all the work that we put in,\" Lee told reporters afterward. \"So seeing all of them go up there and do everything that they were supposed to do after watching them in practice, this is just super cool and I'm so happy for everyone.\"",

With the loss, Canada will finish last in group B and therefore will not make it out of the group. Ezinne Kalu led Nigeria in scoring with 21 points while Shay Colley paced the Canadians with 17 points. The first half was an evenly matched affair as Canada fought to remain in contention to advance, even taking a four point lead into halftime. However, coming out of the break, the Nigerians applied a pressure that the Candians simply could not endure and never recovered from. Nigeria outscored Canada 23-5 in the third quarter, including a 15-0 run to open up an eight point lead. By the midway point of the fourth quarter, the Nigerian lead had ballooned to an insurmountable 17 points as they sealed the deal. Nigeria shot 45 per cent from the field and 38 per cent from deep, but their defense was the catalyst for the critical victory. D'Tigress, the team\u2019s nickname, held Canada to just 37 per cent shooting overall, including an abysmal 5-26 from long distance. The Africans y forced 26 Canadian turnovers which were converted into 27 points on the other end, a massive deciding factor in a game carrying such important implications. Of these 26 turnovers, Nigeria had 16 steals. Another major discrepancy in the game was free throw shooting. Canada got to the line 22 times but only converted 15 of those attempts while Nigeria went 14-17 from the stripe. Pairing turnovers and missed free throws with a poor shooting performance was a recipe for disaster for the Canadians who finished their run at Paris 2024 winless. Nigeria\u2019s defense continues to be the group\u2019s identity after putting on another clinic on that end of the floor. In their upset win over Australia, they forced 26 turnovers including 15 steals. Despite losing to France 75-54 on 1 August, D'Tigress forced another 17 turnovers and had nine steals. Overall, through three games of group play, Nigeria has forced 69 turnovers by their opponents including 40 steals. After handling business on the court, D'Tigress must now wait to see who they draw in their first ever Olympic quarter-final.",

His 15.300 narrowly held off teammate Zou Jingyuan, who posted a 15.233. Greece's Eleftherios Petrounias captured the bronze with a 15.100. It's a second-straight win for Liu, who took gold at Tokyo 2020. No man has defended his still rings Olympic title since Japan's Nakayama Akinori was golden in 1968 and 1972. Petrounious was the champion at Rio 2016. Liu was second in the final, following the masterful work of Zou. In the end the difference between the two, who had matchin 6.4 difficulty scores, came on their respective dismounts. Zou had taken severall, very small movements to bring his double-double dismount under control. That was all Liu needed, as he took a small hop forward on his landing. France's hero Samir Ait Said who suffered a horrific injury on the vault at Rio 2016 finished fourth at 15.000. More to come.",

Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United States will all have teams of four taking on a short\u2011course triathlon, featuring a 300m swim, 8km bike ride, and 2km run. Teams of two men and two women will compete, with the race order reversed since Tokyo 2020 to man, woman, man, woman, with each triathlete tapping the hand of their teammate to set them on their way. Nations who have secured a maximum quota of three male and three female athletes for Olympic triathlon competitions \u2014 men's and women's individual, and mixed team relay \u2014 can pick their four athletes for the latter closer to the event. What is the triathlon mixed relay? The athlete breaking the finishing tape to win gold for their team is swept up in the arms of their excitable compatriots, before having time to draw breath, in a whirl of screaming and shouting after 90 minutes of successful exertion. Or such was the case when Great Britain won the inaugural edition in Japan. USA claimed silver, with France securing bronze. But the hosts will not want anyone but themselves crossing the finish line first across the iconic Pont Alexandre III at their home Games, or have any other nation stand atop the podium, which has the Eiffel Tower as its backdrop. Below, we take a closer look at the stars to watch out for in Paris, a full schedule and how to watch the action.",

        "document": "Three years ago at Tokyo 2020, gymnastics superstar Simone Biles sparked a global conversation about mental health and sports. Over the past week at the Olympic Games Paris 2024, she\u2019s put into practice the example that inspired so many millions across the globe. That\u2019s included therapy sessions before two of her biggest competitions in France, the women\u2019s team and all-around finals, with her U.S. based therapist up in the middle of the night to work with the 27-year-old. \u201cI did see my therapist the other day\u2026. We\u2019re taking it day-by-day to see if I need extra therapy while I\u2019m here, but so far, so good,\u201d said Biles. \u201cThe Olympics is such a draining process for the athletes when it\u2019s multiple days of competition, so you definitely have to be on top of your mental, as well as your physical. So as long as we\u2019re doing that, then, we\u2019re good.\u201d Biles withdrew midway through the women\u2019s team final in Japan, prioritising her mental health as she dealt with a case of the \u2018twisties\u2019 - what gymnasts call when the body and mind fall out of sync. She\u2019s since said it was the inevitable conclusion to years of avoiding dealing with the trauma her sport \u2013 including abuse by the former U.S. team doctor \u2013 had brought her. \u201cYou can\u2019t compress trauma that much longer,\u201d Biles said earlier this year on the popular American podcast Call Her Daddy. \u201cI hate to be the person that blames it on something else because I\u2019d rather blame it on like, \u2018I have a hangnail. Sorry, can\u2019t vault\u2019 or whatever.\u201d Recovery hasn\u2019t been \u2013 and still isn\u2019t \u2013 an easy process. At the time, Biles said felt she was walking away from a dream she had worked five years to achieve. Doubts filled her mind as she worried she\u2019d never regain her otherworldly flips and twists, the ones that had come so naturally, for so long. There were also the doubters online, filling her mentions with hateful tweets and posts accusing her of quitting on her team or failing her country. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is a mental injury that they can\u2019t see,\u2019\u201d Biles recalled. \u201cBecause they couldn\u2019t see it, they couldn\u2019t relate to it. They couldn\u2019t grasp it.\u201d Three Olympic gold medals later in Paris, the American says the online chatter is\u2026 well, different. \u201cThe negative comments, they\u2019re painful after a certain point,\u201d Biles admitted. \u201cThey hurt\u2026 but they\u2019re really quiet now, so that\u2019s strange. \u201cAfter all these years of putting the mental work in,\u201d she continued, \u201cit\u2019s paid off.\u201d That\u2019s worth more than gold.",

Women\u2019s pole vault at Paris 2024 will see two rounds - qualification and the final for the medal. The 30 athletes will be trimmed down for the final after the qualifiers. Athletes can make the cut for the final by achieving the pre-approved entry standard of 4.70m. If fewer than 12 manage to hit the automatic qualifying mark, the next highest-ranked athletes from the qualifiers, up to a total of at least 12, will be included in the final. If more than 12 hit the entry standard in the qualifying round, all who achieve the mark will advance to the final. Kennedy made her Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020 while struggling with injuries and was ousted in the qualifying stage. However, the Aussie pole vaulter enters Paris 2024 as one of the top medal contenders. She is the reigning Commonwealth Games champion in her event and jointly holds the world title with American star Katie Moon, who incidentally is also the gold medal winner from Tokyo 2020. Moon and Kennedy\u2019s decision to share the world championships gold after an enthralling contest in Budapest last year was a much-talked-about affair. Kennedy, the 2022 Diamond League champion, however, has already declared there will be no sharing in Paris. \"I am definitely going for that outright gold medal. It's probably the question I have been asked the most since Budapest. There it felt right, I never second guessed it, it was the right thing to do,\u201d Kennedy told ABC Sports. \"It has definitely ignited a fire within me though to win an outright gold medal.\" Kennedy, who holds the Australian national pole vault record of 4.91m from the Zurich Diamond League last year, comes into Paris on the back of successive Diamond League wins. She vaulted a season-best of 4.88m at Monaco before logging 4.85 in London. Her Monaco performance is the joint second-best mark this season only behind Great Britain\u2019s rising star Molly Caudery, who holds the current world lead of 4.92. Switzerland\u2019s Angelica Moser also has a 4.88m mark this year. Both Moser and Caudery will be threats to Kennedy\u2019s bid for gold at Paris and so will fellow co-world champion Moon. Greece\u2019s Katerina Stefanidi, the Rio 2016 Olympic champion, and New Zealand\u2019s Eliza McCartney, who missed Tokyo 2020 after taking bronze in Rio, will also be in the mix. To date, Tatiana Grigorieva\u2019s silver at Sydney 2000 is the only women\u2019s pole vault Olympic medal in Australia\u2019s athletics coffers.",

Silver went to another German equestrian star in Isabell Werth, while Charlotte 'Lottie' Fry of Great Britain took the bronze. Despite Werth's early lead, Bredow-Werndl delivered a dressage masterclass in musicality and harmony set to classic French music. Aboard her remarkable mare, TSF Dalera BB, von Bredow-Werndl delivered a breathtaking Grand Prix Freestyle performance that earned an impressive score of 90.093 percent, the only one to break the 90-percent barrier on the final day of the dressage competition. Her compatriot, the legendary Werth, secured the silver medal with Wendy, achieving a score of 89.614 percent. This medal marks Werth's 14th Olympic medal, further cementing her legacy as the most decorated Olympic equestrian and German athlete of all time. Just a day prior, Werth had also celebrated a team gold in the Grand Prix special. Joining the German equestrian legends on the podium was Great Britain's Fry, who delivered a stellar performance with Glamourdale to earn 88.971 percent and the bronze medal. Fry's achievement held deep personal significance, as her late mother had competed in dressage at Barcelona 1992 alongside Carl Hester, Fry's teammate. The final competitor, Denmark\u2019s Cathrine Laudrup-Dufour, who had outscored von Bredow-Werndl in the Grand Prix Special, aimed for gold with her horse Freestyle. Despite an engaging pop compilation, a few costly errors led to a score of 88.093 percent, placing her fifth. The historic grounds of Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles hosted the event, with thousands of fans packing the stands to witness equestrian excellence. Freestyle competition allowed athletes to showcase their horses using music of their choice, adding a layer of creativity and personal flair to the ring.

The men\u2019s discus throw event is scheduled to begin on August 5 at the Stade de France. An Australian male athlete is yet to medal in the discus throw competition at the Olympics. Daniela Costian, meanwhile, is the only Australian women\u2019s discus thrower to finish on the Olympic podium, bagging the bronze medal at the Barcelona 1992 Summer Games. The 28-year-old Matt Denny, featuring in his third Olympics, is the only discus thrower from the 14-member Australian athletics contingent. Matthew Denny is the reigning Diamond League and Commonwealth Games discus throw champion. At Rio 2016, Denny made his Olympic debut but failed to make it out of the qualifying round after a 61.16m effort. At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Denny recorded a new personal best of 67.02m, just 0.05cm short of the bronze medal. The men\u2019s discus throw event at the Paris 2024 Olympics starts on August 5 with the qualification rounds. The 32 athletes are split into two qualification groups - A and B. Denny is in Group A. Athletes who meet the qualification standard of 66.00m or at least the 12 best performers will qualify for the discus throw final, which will be held on August 6. Denny\u2019s personal best is 69.35, a national record, achieved in April during the nationals, and earned his quota for the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, he may have to break it again considering three other athletes competing in Paris have a season-best throw of over 70m. The field comprises defending Olympic and reigning world champion Daniel St\u00e5hl of Sweden and Tokyo 2020 bronze medallist Lukas Wei\u00dfhaidinger of Austria, to whom Denny lost bronze in the last Games.

At La Chapelle Arena, Sen, 22nd in the badminton rankings, lost to world No. 2 Axelsen 22-20, 21-14 in 54 minutes. The Indian shuttler had the first game under control before collapsing. Lakshya Sen began the second game with a monumental 7-0 lead before Axelsen roared back to take the game and march into his second straight Olympic final. The 22-year-old Sen could still become the first Indian badminton player to win an Olympic medal in the men\u2019s event. He will take on world No. 7 Lee Zii Jia of Malaysia in the bronze medal match on Monday. Lakshya Sen has a 4-1 head-to-head record against the Malaysian, including a win at the All England Open earlier this year. The semi-final began with Sen making three errors, gifting Axelsen a 3-0 lead before a series of strong defensive and attacking combinations allowed the 22-year-old Lakshya to draw level at 5-5. Lakshya Sen took the lead for the first time with a fantastic cross-court smash to make it 7-6 and marched into the break with an 11-9 lead. He then opened up a six-point lead at 15-9 and capitalised on Axelsen making a couple of enforced errors to make it 17-11. A two-time Olympic medallist, Axelsen then won four consecutive points and sensationally saved three game points to make it 20-20 before taking the first game 22-20. Sen made a service error when the score was at 20-17, which allowed the momentum to swing in the Dane\u2019s favour. Lakshya Sen, however, bounced back almost immediately and took a sizable 7-0 lead to begin the second game. However, Axelsen showed his pedigree once again and won six of the next seven points and eventually drew level at 10-10. Sen went into the break with an 11-10 lead but the Olympic champion took the lead in the second game for the first time at 13-12. The Dane won nine of the next 12 points to clinch the second game and storm into the gold medal match where he will face world No. 8 Kunlavut Vitidsarn of Thailand. This was the reigning Olympic champion\u2019s eighth victory over Sen, who has managed just one win. The Indian badminton ace\u2019s only win against the Danish shuttler came in the German Open more than two years ago. In the quarter-finals, the unseeded Lakshya Sen defeated Chinese Taipei\u2019s Chou Tien-chen in a hard-fought three-game encounter. As a result, he became the first Indian shuttler to reach the badminton men\u2019s singles semi-finals at the Summer Games. Parupalli Kashyap and Kidambi Srikanth previously reached the quarter-finals at London 2012 and Rio 2016, respectively. Lakshya Sen, on his Olympic debut, topped his men\u2019s singles group, by beating reigning All England champion and world No. 4 Jonatan Christie. He also got the better of his compatriot HS Prannoy in the round of 16.",

The trio who topped the podium at Tokyo 2020 will be among the favourites to succeed again in Paris, but they won't be alone.

At the Stade de France, Parul Chaudhary, a two-time Asian Games medallist, finished eighth in her women\u2019s 3000m steeplechase heat with a season-best time of 9:23.39. However, with only the top five athletes advancing, she failed to qualify for the final of the athletics event. Meanwhile, Jeswin Aldrin recorded a best attempt of 7.61m in the men\u2019s long jump qualification to finish 13th in his heat. He neither achieved the direct qualification standard of 8.15m nor did he finish among the top 12 athletes. The 29-year-old Parul is the Indian national record holder in this event and clocked 9:15.31 at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest in 2023. Not even her personal best would have assured Parul a spot in the final with the fifth-place qualifying athlete - Lomi Muleta of Ethiopia - clocking 9:10.73. Defending Olympic champion Peruth Chemutai of Uganda qualified in first place with 9:10.51. This was the second event for Parul Chaudhary at Paris 2024. She also competed in the women\u2019s 5000m race but couldn\u2019t make the final after finishing 14th in her heat with another season\u2019s best of 15:10.68. Parul also holds the national record in that event with 15:10.35. In the men\u2019s long jump qualification, Jeswin Aldrin\u2019s first two attempts were ruled invalid before he landed a 7.61m jump with his final effort. It was an underwhelming performance from the long jump national record holder. The 24-year-old achieved the 8.42m long jump national record at the Indian Open Jumps Competition in March last year.",

The eighth-seed Lovlina Borgohain, competing in the women\u2019s 75kg event, lost the match by a 4:1 split decision to Li Qian, the reigning Asian Games champion. Lovlina Borgohain, a Tokyo 2020 bronze winner, would have assured a medal by winning this fight. In Olympic boxing, two bronze medals are awarded, one each to the losing semi-finalists. In the fight, Li Qian started well with some strong punches but Lovlina, who took her time to get going, too returned some crucial jabs. As the bout progressed, the 26-year-old Indian boxer was pushed further on the backfoot by Li Qian, whose strong attack helped her land enough blows to edge out the reigning middleweight world champion. In the opening round earlier this week, Lovlina registered a convincing 5:0 victory against Sunniva Hofstad of Norway. Lovlina had booked her Paris 2024 berth by reaching the women\u2019s 75kg final at the Asian Games last year. Once again, it was Li Qian who defeated her in the final in Hangzhou. Four of the six Indian boxers at the Paris 2024 Olympics failed to reach the quarter-finals. Nishant Dev made it to the quarters as well in the men\u2019s 71kg but lost to the second-seed Marco Verde of Mexico on Saturday. Two-time world champion Nikhat Zareen, Asian Games bronze medallist Preeti Pawar and reigning Commonwealth champion Amit Panghal exited in the round of 16. Jaismine Lamboria, meanwhile, lost her opening match in the round of 32.",

Harmanpreet Singh (22\u2019) opened India\u2019s account to register his seventh goal of the tournament while Lee Morton (27\u2019) scored Great Britain\u2019s only goal with the India vs Great Britain hockey match ending in a 1-1 draw after full time. This is India\u2019s second consecutive appearance in the semi-finals of the men\u2019s hockey Olympic tournament, having won the bronze medal at Tokyo 2020. The first quarter saw both teams cancel out each other\u2019s offensive moves. Both keepers were called into action, but no goals were scored. The match took a major turn in the second 15, though, as India\u2019s Amit Rohidas was shown a red card after his hockey stick hit the opponent\u2019s face during a duel. Despite going down to 10 men, skipper Harmanpreet Singh produced a moment of magic from a penalty corner. His trademark drag flick flew past keeper Ollie Payne to establish a surprise lead for the Indian team. However, Lee Morton equalised a few minutes later for Great Britain. After PR Sreejesh saved the initial attempts, Morton\u2019s shot squeezed past the Indian keeper as both teams went into half-time with one goal apiece. With the numerical advantage, Great Britain dominated the third quarter, barely giving an opportunity for the Indian hockey team to get into their attacking half. Great Britain had a few terrific opportunities in the final few minutes of the final quarter as well but failed to find a way past the stringent Indian defence. PR Sreejesh was caught in a two-on-one situation but made a terrific save to keep India alive. Despite chasing the ball for a major part of the match, India ensured they headed to the shootout. In the shootout, Harmanpreet Singh, Sukhjeet Singh, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay and Rajkumar Pal scored for India. For Great Britain, Connor Williamson fired his shot wide, while Sreejesh saved Phillip Roper\u2019s attempt. In the Paris 2024 Olympics hockey semi-finals, India will play the winner of the quarter-finals between Germany and Argentina on Tuesday.",

In devastating scenes in the Porte de la Chapelle Arena, the Spanish badminton star collapsed to the floor after landing awkwardly on her surgically repaired knee, just 11 points away from making the Olympic final. A cry of \"oh no\" on dropping to the court, the Rio 2016 gold medallist in women's singles put her hand to her face in distress while opponent He Bingjiao of the People's Republic of China signalled Marin needed assistance. With one game up and 10-6 up in the second game, Marin was on her way for a comeback of the ages to make an Olympic final after several years hampered by multiple injuries, including two serious knee surgeries. The crowd's concern was palpable as Marin writhed on the floor. But this is the Olympic Games and Marin attempted to continue. Barely able to walk let alone play, Marin crumpled to the floor again after a couple more points, her face contorted with disappointment and pain. She wept uncontrollably, pounding the court in frustration. Her coach was quickly on the scene, able to do nothing but place a hand on Marin's back. No words were spoken.",

The event kicked off with the preliminary round on Saturday followed by round 1. The semi-final and the 100m final will be held on Sunday, which will be early on Monday morning Australian time. The Paris 2024 Olympics men\u2019s 100m will be available to watch on live streaming and on TV in Australia. On the second day, the proceedings will begin with three semi-final races. Each race has nine sprinters. From these, the top two in each heat and next two fastest will advance to the final later in the day. The field includes defending Olympic 100m champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy. Other notable names include world No. 1 Noah Lyles of the USA, the Tokyo 2020 bronze medal winner in the 200m and the reigning world champion in both the 100m and 200m. Canada\u2019s Andre De Grasse, the defending 200m champion and 100m bronze medallist in Tokyo and Fred Kerley, runner-up in the 100m in Tokyo and a 2022 world champion, make up the stacked field. Jamaica\u2019s Kishane Thompson has the world-leading time of 9.77 seconds, set when he won the Olympic trials in Kingston. Kenya's African record holder Ferdinand Omanyala holds the second-fastest time of the season. Noah Lyle is third with a season-best of 9.81, set at the London Diamond League last month, followed by Jamaica\u2019s Oblique Seville, just a hundredth off. Marcell Jacobs\u2019 best effort this year has been a 9.92. Usain Bolt holds both the 100m Olympic record of 9.63s, set at London 2012, and the world record time of 9.58s, set at the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin. Australia had two entries for the 100m event at the Paris 2024 Olympics \u2013 Rohan Browning and Joshua Azzopardi. Both participated in round 1 and were knocked out. Joshua Azzopardi ran 10.20s in heat 2 to finish fourth while Rohan Browning ran in heat 6 and clocked a season-best 10.29 to finish sixth. Only the first three in each heat and the next three fastest advanced to the semi-final.",

Richardson, 24, came out of the blocks slow in the damp conditions and never recovered, with Alfred leading early and refusing to relent. The gap was too much for Sha'Carri, who has been known to chase down opponents, including last year at the World Championships when she soared to gold from lane 9.

Richardson achieves that in her Olympic debut with training mate Melissa Jefferson joining her on the podium, claiming the bronze medal.

The unseeded Indian boxer, making his debut at the Summer Games, lost to Mexico\u2019s second-seeded Marco Verde by a 4:1 split decision. A victory in this bout would have assured a medal for Nishant, as two bronze medals are awarded in Olympic boxing to the losing semi-finalists. In the fight, the 22-year-old Marco Verde was set on the backfoot straight away by the Indian, who landed a few strong jabs at the Mexican. Four of the five judges ruled Nishant Dev to be ahead at the end of the opening three minutes, but Verde turned the bout around in the next two rounds as fatigue overtook the Indian boxer. Nishant had beaten Verde at the 2021 World Championships. \"I have a lot of respect for him,\" Verde said. \"He is very technically sound boxer. My coaches asked me to play smart after I lost the first round.\" Nishant Dev had qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics boxing event after beating Moldova\u2019s Vasile Cebotari 5-0 in the men\u2019s 71kg quarter-finals at the World Boxing Qualifiers in May. In his opening round, the 23-year-old Nishant defeated Ecuador\u2019s Jose Gabriel Tenorio Rodriguez by a 3:2 split decision on Wednesday. Nishant fell just short of a medal at the Asian Games as well last year. He lost to Japan\u2019s Sewon Okazawa in the men\u2019s 71kg quarter-finals Four of the six Indian boxers at Paris 2024 failed to reach the final eight stages.

The 31-year-old American became the first man to win three gold medals in the throws event at the Games adding to the titles he won in Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 in 2021. Crouser produced a season\u2019s best heave of 22.90 metres to clinch his record-setting third Olympic gold. Joe Kovacs rose to the occasion on his final attempt of the night, moving from fourth to second place to clinch his third consecutive silver with a distance of 22.15m for another USA 1-2 podium. Rounding out the podium, Rajindra Campbell became the first Jamaican ever to win a shot-put medal at the Olympics with a best throw of 22.15m. As he entered Stade de France, Crouser lunged into a thinker pose before he made his way to the shot-put circle. Crouser threw down the gauntlet with a monstrous opening heave of 22.64m before basking in the vibe of the stadium. With that throw, Crouser put some distance between himself and his challengers. He added five centimetres on his second attempt and tightened his grip on the third with his best throw of the year, launching the put to 22.90m. Rain started falling, complicating matters for the men looking to knock Crouser off his perch. Crouser had two no-throws on his fourth and fifth attempts, but it would be of no consequence as he had the gold all wrapped up. The American giant completed a remarkable comeback for his third Olympic gold after suffering a slew of injuries since winning his back-to-back world titles in 2022 and 2023. The world record holder battled an elbow injury before he tore his pectoral muscle during a bench press workout in April.",

The women\u2019s vault final here in the French capital has been her target since she tripped at Tokyo 2020, balking on her intended first vault and knocking herself out of medal contention. \"I've been anticipating this day for a really long time, and it was one of my biggest motivators to get back here and be in the vault final,\u201d Carey said, the bronze medal that she captured behind teammate Simone Biles and Tokyo champ Rebeca Andrade around her neck. \"So, to be able to just prove myself and prove to myself that I can do two vaults in a final and to walk with the medal is really special for me.\" It's been hard earned, too. Carey says not been feeling well in Paris, falling ill in the lead up to Team USA\u2019s women\u2019s podium training session last Thursday (25 July). After the opening round of competitio, she revealed to Olympics.com, exclusively, that she had been battling illness. \u201cI started my week throwing up, so that was kind of hard because it just takes all your energy,\u201d Carey said Saturday. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat, you feel like you just want to lay in bed, but I didn\u2019t really have time to lay in bed.

Representing Ireland, McClenaghan scored 15.533 to beat Nariman Kurbanov of Kazakhstan into second (15.433), while Stephen Nedoroscik of Team USA secured bronze with 15.300. Team GB's Max Whitlock finished just off the podium in fourth (15.200) in his final Olympic Games. The pommel horse final opened with a monster opening score from Kurbanov, the 2022 Asian Games bronze medallist, scoring 15.433, a hefty 0.433 above his qualification score of 15.000, which brought him into this final in sixth place. It was going to take some going to beat that, but the next gymnast up, Team GB's Whitlock, was the two-time gold medallist on the apparatus. Competing in front of five-year-old daughter Willow, Whitlock completed his super-difficult routine but a couple of loose moments in a final as tight as this meant he finished off the podium in fourth. The result meant he just missed out on an Olympic history-making moment in becoming the first gymnast to win four medals on the same apparatus, having secured bronze at his first Games at London 2012 and gold at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020.

Up against a formidable opponent in Japan, it needed a real moment of magic to break the deadlock - and that is exactly what Trinity Rodman and Crystal Dunn combined to provide. In the first half of extra-time, from inside her own half, Dunn sprayed a perfectly executed pass across the pitch and into the feet of her team-mate. Having struggled to get the better of her opposing defender for 90 minutes, Rodman made no mistake this time, shifting into space and putting the ball into the top corner in emphatic fashion for the only goal in a 1-0 win (105'+2). At 22, she became the youngest player to score an extra-time goal for the USWNT since Heather O'Reilly at Athens 2004. It was a hard-fought contest between the two rivals, rich in history, with Japan fighting until the very end. But ultimately, Hayes's patience with her players and reluctance to make too many changes paid off, with a mix of youth and experience proving to be the difference this time around.

It was a moment worthy of being hung in the Louvre, as the 24-year-old Belgian cyclist free-wheeled across the finish line, arms outstretched in front of the Eiffel Tower, embracing his historic achievement of becoming the first male cyclist to win the road race and time trial at the same edition of the Olympic Games. \u201cI achieved everything I wanted to achieve this month: Tour [de France] and double gold is... my season, I cannot describe it,\u201d said cycling\u2019s newest Olympic champion. He sat in the peloton for much of the race, enjoying a leisurely ride through the centre and suburbs of Paris. However, Evenepoel was not in the French capital to sightsee; he was there to conquer. As the peloton approached 100km to go, the crouching tiger became a hidden dragon. Evenepoel made his presence known, chasing down attacks and launching a few of his own off the front of the peloton. None of those moves would prove decisive, however, and he retreated back into the mass of riders to lie in wait for the perfect moment to commence his own cycling revolution in the centre of Paris. It was on the first climb of the C\u00f4te de la Butte Montmartre that the peloton splintered, with world champion Mathieu van der Poel of the Netherlands and medal favourite Wout van Aert of Belgium leading the charge. Evenepoel was able to catch up to the pair on the descent afterwards, launching a ferocious attack that caught the remaining members of the peloton off guard. Free to fly, the Belgian cyclist put his time-trial skills to use, catching the leading group of breakaway riders before the second climb of the C\u00f4te de la Butte Montmartre. He used the climb to drop the weakest riders from the leading group, leaving himself and France\u2019s Valentin Madouas at the front of the race. The pair rode quickly around the centre of Paris, with dreams of medals becoming more realistic. They approached the cobbled C\u00f4te de la Butte Montmartre for the final time, and it was on the climb that Evenepoel made the winning move. He dropped Madouas and rode free towards the finish. He cranked his pedals with the maximum amount of power possible, establishing a minute gap on the French rider. His gap was so large that even a flat tyre in front of the Louvre couldn\u2019t stop him from a date with destiny. He crossed the finish line in a time of 6:19.34, completing the 273km course more than a minute faster than his nearest rival. \u201cBeing almost sure with 4k to go and then having a flat with 4k to go doesn\u2019t help the stress and the excitement in the moment,\u201d said Evenepoel. \u201cBut it\u2019s a dream coming true once again.\u201d France\u2019s Valentin Madouas held off the remnants of the peloton to claim a popular silver medal. He crossed the line in a time of 6:20.45 to claim his nation\u2019s first medal in the men\u2019s road race since Melbourne 1956. He was joined on the podium by fellow Frenchman Christophe Laporte, who rode away from the rest of the peloton in the final 300m to claim the bronze medal in front of thousands of screaming fans.",

Tokyo 2020 champion Rebeca Andrade won the silver at 14.966, followed by American Jade Carey (14.466). For Biles, it's a third gold in Paris, and overall her seventh Olympic title and 10th medal at the Games. She was previously Olympic champion on vault at Rio 2016. When the American warmed up her signature Yurchenko double pike, the daring vault that bears her name, Biles rolled straight to her back. Throughout the 2024 season she's talked about how she can overpower the vault, so as she stood at the end of the runway readying herself coach Laurent Landi wanted to her remain patient and calm. \"Laurent was signaling like, calm down, take your time. Just so that I don't overpower it because, obviously, once you get up there, your adrenaline is pumping,\" explained Biles. \"So he wanted to make sure that I was staying calm and going on my own time, even though the [scoreboard] said, 'Go' and everybody started cheering, he's just like, 'Calm down. Wait. You're good.'\" Better than good. She was great. \"I kinda nailed that one,\" Biles said, beaming. The vault, which carries with it a massive 6.4 difficulty score, .8 more than any other vault in the final, scored 15.700. Biles, then, soared her on her Cheng vault, earning a 14.900.",

The South Korean archer was part of the gold-medal winning trio in the women\u2019s team event at Paris 2024. India\u2019s Bhajan Kaur, meanwhile, was ousted in the round of 16 stage. Deepika Kumari started the match well and capitalised on her opponent hitting two eights to win the first set 28-26. However, a wayward six from the Indian archer in the second set allowed the Korean archer to draw level. The Indian hit two 10s and a nine in a strong third set to take a 4-2 lead in the tie. However, a seven sandwiched between two 10s undid all of Deepika\u2019s hard work as Nam Suhyeon restored parity once again at 4-4. In the final set, Deepika could only manage three nines while the 19-year-old Korean hit two 10s to secure the tie and marched into the semi-finals. Deepika Kumari entered the quarter-finals after beating two-time Olympic medallist Michelle Kroppen of Germany. Kroppen, who won the mixed team silver medal at Paris 2024, began the round of 16 clash with a six which allowed the Indian to take the first set 27-24. The second set was tied 27-27 and the 30-year-old Deepika won the third set to make it 5-1. Kroppen clinched two 10s in the following set to claw her way back to 5-3 but it wasn\u2019t enough as Deepika hit a 10 in the final set to match the German at 27-all and won the tie 6-4.

In the shoot-off, however, the Indian hit an eight in response to the Indonesian\u2019s nine and got eliminated.\n\nBhajan Kaur beat Kamal Syfia Nurafifah Kamal of Indonesia 7-3 to begin her women\u2019s individual campaign in the round of 64. She then blanked Wioleta Myszor of Poland 6-0 to reach the pre-quarter-finals. The Polish archer had eliminated Ankita Bhakat of India 6-4 in the opening round. None of the Indian male archers managed to progress beyond the round of 32 in the men\u2019s individual event. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, meanwhile, crashed out in the quarter-finals.

They were unable to pull off the same trick in the semi-final, however, where Kantor and Maggetti progressed to the medal race, where they would face Wilson, all knowing an Olympic medal was secured but not kowing which colour would be theirs. All three crossed the startline cleanly, with Team GB's Wilson taking the lead, with Kantor in second, and Italy third. Wilson erred when opting to extend one of the legs in order to get a better run at the mark, but that left her out of position. Maggetti, meanwhile, decided she had nothing to lose and split from the other two racers, and by the time she rejoined, was in the lead. The race had been upended with Maggetti now leading, Kantor in second, and Wilson, in third. And this is how it stayed until race end with Maggetti claiming gold at her second Olympic Games, coming in the dreaded fourth place in Tokyo - and securing Italy's first sailing gold since Sydney 2000.

Notably missing from that lineup are the reigning Olympic champions Belgium, who after their first loss of the entire tournament, will no longer have a shot at defending their Olympic title. India and Great Britain kicked off the day of play at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir, and it was India who defeated the world No. 2 Brits in an overtime shoot-out, as the odds were stacked against them with a man down for nearly three-quarters of the match. Before Paris, India sat three places behind the Brits on the FIH world rankings. When two-time Olympian Harmanpreet Singh was asked whether or not he believes that India could take their first Olympic gold in men\u2019s hockey since 1980, he said \u201cWe can. The belief is there, the team is very confident after the game and we are going to go higher and higher.\u201d The second game of the day was Spain\u2019s major upset over Belgium, recapped further below. Right after the Tokyo 2020 gold medallists were eliminated from the tournament, the silver medallists from three years ago also lost their opportunity to improve their standing as Australia was beaten by the Netherlands. Germany\u2019s victory over Argentina concluded the day and the four remaining men\u2019s teams will take the Olympic stage next for the semi-finals on 6 August as tensions continue to rise.",

In Fukuoka, World Champs in 2023, I came fourth. That was the most painful 1500. This was second most painful.\" Out of this suffering, however, also comes camaraderie. Long-distance swimmers know the challenges that each one goes through more than anyone else. And even when split up on the podium, their mutual respect shines through. \"It's definitely the most friendly event out of all the strokes because we all appreciate it,\" Wiffen said of the 1500m. \"We all do the hard training. Nobody's slacking and it shows. And I'm so happy for Bobby to break that record because it was years ago.

The American sprint star who has launched a personal campaign over the last few years to raise the profile of global athletics just exploded on its biggest stage: The Olympic Games as 100-metre champion at Paris 2024. But it's not an act. Lyles, ever the showman, outspoken, electrifying and unafraid to set expectations sky-high for himself, soared when it mattered most, running his fastest-ever 100m race to clip Jamaica's Kishane Thompson at the line by five thousandths of a second. If you think this was the Hollywood ending that the 27-year-old from Gainesville, Florida, has long dreamed of, you'd only be partly right. He set out the goal of winning not one, not two, not three but four gold medals at these Games. And, he says, the 100m isn't even his best event. \"It feels good to back it up,\" Lyles said of his on-track performance aligning with his big-talking ways after his victory. What does he want next? \"I want my own shoe,\" he said. \"I want my own trainer \u2014 I'm dead serious. There ain't no money in spikes, it's in sneakers. And even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety we get \u2026 the fact that that hasn't happened, that's crazy to me.

She looks every bit relaxed on the Olympic stage, showing no sign of the attention that has come flooding her way. At 11 years old, Zheng will start the women\u2019s park contest as the youngest athlete at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 and the youngest ever to represent the People\u2019s Republic of China. It tops a remarkable rise for the skater from Huizhou, whose late surge at the Olympic Qualifier Series in Shanghai and Budapest allowed her to lift her world ranking to 26th and muscle in on the Olympic action. Naturally, the interest in her and her historic showing has been significant, not least given the 40-year age gap between her and the oldest skateboarder at the Games, Andy Macdonald (51). The Briton, famed for his vert skating, had won all 23 of his X Games medals before Zheng was even born, and likewise has received recognition for his age.

Lyles shared the podium with Jamaican Kishane Thompson (9.789) and compatriot Fred Kerley (9.81s). Jacobs has not only been plagued by injuries since his magical run at the National Stadium in Tokyo where he clocked a personal best of 9.80s. The 29-year-old has been unable to replicate that performance during the last cycle building up to Paris. Perhaps in true Jacobs style, he left his best for last coming within a whisker of his lifetime best and another Olympic 100m podium. Jacobs also clocked a season\u2019s best in his semi-final where he finished third, initially missing out on an automatic spot in the final. But his time of 9.92s was good enough to see him through to the final as one of the two fastest non-automatic qualifiers. The maximum effort he put in to make it to the final had taken its toll on Jacobs as he suffered from cramps after the race. \u201cI can't be happy, even though my reaction time out of the blocks was excellent. However, I gave more than 100 percent, I pushed to the maximum,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cI worked so much and so hard during this period, and I wanted to win a medal even if 9.85 seconds is not a time to throw away. \u201cIn past editions, that would have made it to the podium, but not this time.

However, it was the precision and determination of Shikine Takahiro, Iimura Kazuki, Matasuyama Kyosuke and Nagano Yudai that led Japan to a gold medal with a 45-36 win over the Italians. \u201cWe still can't believe what we achieved today,\u201d said Matsuyama. \u201cThis means a lot for the future of fencing in Japan, and I hope that in the next Olympics and in the future, many more Japanese will take up fencing and win more medals.\" Japan got off to a sensational start, with Shikine lodging a 5-3 victory over Tommaso Marini in the first period. Iimura built on his lead, adding a further touch against Guillaume Bianchi. Italy was not to be taken lightly, however, as Filippo Macchi delivered a 7-5 victory over Matasuyama in the third period. His victory swung the momentum in Italy\u2019s direction, with Bianchi overcoming a one-touch loss in the second period to beat Shikine 6-3 in the fourth period. A tied period between Marini and Matsuyama saw Italy retain the lead, but Japan was about to take it up a notch. Iimura entered the piste for the second time in the match, and it would be a memorable minute. He decimated Macchi\u2019s defence, delivering touches with precision and poise. His dominance was rewarded with a four-touch swing, giving Japan a two-touch lead heading into the final three periods. Bianchi would recover a touch in the seventh period, but it would prove futile by the end of the match. The eighth period brought a copious helping of drama, as both Italy and Japan elected to use their substitute fencers. Alessio Foconi entered the piste for Italy, while Nagano Yudai took over duties for Japan. It would be a definitive switch, as Nagano scored a shoutout victory over Foconi, adding five touches to Japan\u2019s lead. Try as he might, the deficit was too severe for Marini to overcome in the final period. He faced an impeccable Iimura, who won his third period of the match to seal victory for Japan. Matsuyama summed up the experience, saying, \"It's an amazing venue, this is my second Olympic Games, but at Tokyo 2020 there were no crowds, so to be here and hear people cheering for us and for everybody else, what a feeling. I really enjoyed this competition.\" The French team of Enzo Lefort, Maxime Pauty and Maximilien Chastanet could certainly feel the atmosphere during their bronze-medal match against the United States. They emerged victorious, winning the bronze medal match 45-32. \"We\u2019re happy. We have done our job, and we\u2019ll be able to join the party,\u201d said Lefort. It was the perfect ending to a week of spectacular fencing at Paris 2024.",

At Tokyo 2020, Brown made headlines after becoming Great Britain's youngest-ever Olympic medallist, striking bronze in the inaugural women's park contest. Three years later, Brown, now 16, is hoping to go better in Paris with Olympic gold firmly in her sights. The journey to the Games in France for the young historymaker has been far from straightforward. After two opening Olympic qualifier wins - including at the delayed 2022 world championships - Brown took leave from the concrete bowl to pursue a quota spot for surfing at Paris. Despite her best attempts, the teenager came up short of her goal and returned her focus to skate. Then just as Brown was readying for the Olympic Qualifier Series, the Briton's preparations took a turn after she tore her medial collateral ligament (MCL). It subsequently sidelined from the first stop of the two-part event in Shanghai. Back in time for Budapest, but still supporting a brace, doubts circled Brown's form. Any such concerns, however, didn't last long. Blitzing through the contest, the young skateboarder finished the event in second place behind Arisa Trew. But just when it seemed like Brown was finally out of the woods, news landed that she had dislocated her shoulder on the eve of her departure for Paris. Determined still to skate, and given the all-clear to do so, Brown will once more look to defy injury and at excel at the Games. As she gears up for her Olympic return, discover all the details you need to watch the Briton in action live including her schedule in full.",

But what is more surprising is that the word she repeats throughout her conversation with Olympics.com has nothing to do with speed or pace, or even winning. Instead, Hodgkinson\u2019s word of choice coming into these Games seems to be \u201cnavigate\u201d. It\u2019s as if Olympic gold sits at the end of a winding map, or even a maze where there are many paths an athlete can take to reach the final destination, but almost all of them finish with dead ends. Hodgkinson has experienced those dead ends three times at major athletics competitions. Firstly, as a hungry 19-year-old, an underdog in the Olympic final in Tokyo, who navigated her way to the medal race but found the road to Olympic gold blocked - just - by the slightly faster legs of the reigning gold medallist Athing Mu. Mu repeated the feat at her home world championships in 2022, before another challenger, Kenya\u2019s Mary Moraa, proved to be the impassable obstacle at the Worlds in 2023. How hardship inspired greatness in Mary Moraa And while Hodgkinson entered these Olympics in Paris as the favourite, having posted the fastest time in the world this year and become the sixth-fastest 800m runner in history in her last race before these Games, she seems well aware that while the track at the Stade de France seems to be a simple combination of bends and straight lines, the race for gold will need a skilled and tactical navigator. \u201cEvery race is very different and it does depend on who\u2019s beside you in the race,\u201d the 22-year-old Hodgkinson explained. \u201cAlso, you don\u2019t know what people have got in their locker. Like I say, with the times on the sheet, someone could PB by a whole second, you\u2019re just not aware of that, so I don\u2019t like putting too much into times and just focus on putting together a race that I\u2019d be really happy with that will get me the result I want. \u201cI\u2019ll just go with that approach each round and navigate like that.\u201d",

He showed no sign of tiring, instead Finke increased his lead with every 50m. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind as the final 100m bell rang was whether he would be able to keep his lead and get the world record time in the sprint finish? The answer was a definitive yes, as Finke increased his speed to chase down the world record and become a back-to-back Olympic gold medalist. Prior to Finke\u2019s win, Team USA had yet to win an individual men\u2019s gold medal at Paris 2024, a fact not lost on Finke, who said: \u201cI knew going into the race I was the last individual swimmer for the guys. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know how the race was going to play out. I was feeling pretty good at the first 300, I saw I had a decent lead and I knew I really just wanted to try to hold it. \u201cI was maybe a body length (ahead). I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t let go of this now. I can\u2019t be the guy who got ran down after I do all the running down\u2019. That was a big factor in my mind. I just kept that back there and I was just trying to keep going.\u201d Finke kept going, he said, his plan was to \u201chopefully try to make the guys hurt a little bit trying to catch up to me - but they started catching up to me\u201d. He added: \u201cI was getting a little worried but I knew I just had to keep pushing. As long as I can keep a little bit of the distance, I knew I was in a good shape for the end of the race.\u201d",

It was a stunning victory for the American rider, who started cycling after a collegiate rowing career. The 31-year-old was stuck in a state of disbelief after crossing the finish line in sight of the Eiffel Tower. Responding to a question about her victory, Faulkner said: \u201cI don\u2019t know - you tell me what happened.\u201d Thankfully, Olympics.com can. Faulkner spent much of the race inside the safety of the peloton, enjoying a leisurely ride through the outskirts of Paris. She conserved her energy, letting teams with more riders chase down an early breakaway that included Afghan sisters Fariba Hashimi and Yulduz Hashimi. She maneuvered her way through the mass of riders, as the peloton approached the first pass of the Cote de la Butte Montmartre. This proved to be a decisive moment in the road race, as Chloe Dygert (USA) crashed towards the front of the peloton, causing the group to splinter into many smaller ones. Faulkner drove the pace at the front of the race, making it harder for medal favorites caught out by the crash to catch the leaders. She shared the responsibility with other riders, making sure to conserve more energy for the final passes of the Cote de la Butte Montmartre. The Netherlands\u2019 Marianne Vos and Hungary\u2019s Blanka Vas managed to slip away from the lead group, striking it out on their own, with their dreams of medals looking more realistic by the kilometer. However, Faulkner was not done yet. She charged up the final pass of the Cote de la Butte Montmartre, eating into the gap with every pedal stroke. Her furious pace destroyed the chasing group, with only Belgium\u2019s Lotte Kopecky remaining on her wheel. The pair could see Vos and Vas as they summited the final climb, waiting for the perfect time to strike. Faulkner and Kopecky worked together to close the gap, catching Vos and Vas with three kilometers to go. The eventual gold medalist wasted no time, attacking her three rivals immediately. \u201cI knew I had to attack them as soon as we caught them,\u201d said Faulkner. \u201cI knew they were sprinters. But I knew they didn\u2019t want to work together - they were three different countries. I knew if I got a small gap they would have to race for second.\u201d She was right. No one could match her move. Faulkner was home free, speeding towards the Trocadero to claim an Olympic gold medal in front of her parents. \u201cThis is a dream come true. I\u2019m still looking at that finish line sign wondering how my name got there,\u201d said a shocked Faulkner.",

The women\u2019s 1500m semi-final is on August 9 and the final on August 11. Jessica Hull made headlines by breaking the world record in the women\u2019s 2000m race at the Monaco Diamond League last month. The 27-year-old clocked 5:19.70 to win the gold and also eclipsed the previous world record of 5:21.56, set by Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi three years ago. The 2000m, however, is a non-Olympic category. Jessica Hull achieved some impressive results in the women's 1500m as well. At the Eugene Diamond League in May, she completed her race in 3:55:97 to set the new national record. She became the first Australian athlete to clock under 3:56.00 in the women\u2019s 1500m race and won the silver medal. The 27-year-old Jessica also holds the Australian record in the 5000m and indoor 3000m. Australia have won three medals so far in 1500m - two gold and one bronze medal. Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edwin Flack won the 1500m race in the inaugural 1896 edition, while John Landy won a bronze in Melbourne 1956.

Panghal, a two-time junior world champion and world championships medallist, will be the youngest Indian wrestler at this Olympic Summer Games. Antim Panghal obtained a Paris 2024 Olympic quota for India in the women's 53kg with a bronze medal at the World Championships last year. Panghal lost to Vanesa Kaladzinskaya of Belarus in the semis, but defeated Sweden\u2019s Jonna Malmgren, a two-time European champion, to win the bronze there. The Indian wrestler had a memorable 2023 season, which was headlined by the bronze medal in the World Championships. Another major highlight of her crowning year was the silver medal at the Asian Championships in Astana, where she lost to Japan\u2019s star wrestler Akari Fujinami. She also defended her U-20 world crown and went on to clinch a bronze medal at the Asian Games 2023 in October. However, Panghal has not competed since coming back from Hangzhou. She was exempted from India\u2019s selection trials for the Asian Wrestling Championships and the Asian Olympic Qualifying Tournament.

Antim Panghal will face some stern challenges in the women\u2019s 53kg wrestling event, most notably Akari Fujinami of Japan. She is the reigning two-time world champion, the current Asian Games gold medallist and also a two-time reigning Asian champion. She currently has an unbeaten streak in well over a hundred matches. The event also has the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Pang Qianyu, the Tokyo 2020 silver medallist and a two-time worlds medal winner. She is also a two-time Asian champion and an Asian Games silver medallist.

The Tokyo 2020 silver medallist will feature in her pet women\u2019s 49kg weightlifting event in Paris and will be aiming to improve the colour of her medal from the last Olympic Summer Games. After her historic podium finish in Tokyo, Mirabai won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham and a silver at the 2022 IWF World Championships. However, Chanu has only lifted in three competitions since due to injuries. She placed sixth at the Asian Championships 2023 and fourth at the Asian Games 2023, where she suffered a hip injury that sidelined her for five months. This year, Mirabai Chanu\u2019s only competitive outing was at the IWF World Cup in Qatar, which was a mandatory event for Paris 2024 qualification. She finished 12th there with a modest lift of 184kg (81kg snatch + 103kg clean and jerk) - a far cry from her personal best of 205kg. Mirabai Chanu\u2019s medal-winning effort at Tokyo 2020, meanwhile, was 202kg. With very little competitive action over the last two years, Mirabai Chanu will be tested in a world-class 12-lifter field in Paris, which also includes Tokyo 2020 champion Hou Zhihui of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand\u2019s Surodchana Khambao, a former world champion, and the United States\u2019 Jourdan Delacruz, a former Pan American champion. This will be Mirabai Chanu\u2019s third Olympic appearance. She didn\u2019t rank at Rio 2026 after failing to log a successful clean and jerk attempt. Mirabai Chanu and Karnam Malleswari (bronze in women\u2019s 69kg at Sydney 2000) are the only Indian weightlifters to have won a medal at the Olympics to date. Weightlifting at the Paris 2024 Olympics will be held from August 7 to 11 at the South Paris Arena. Mirabai Chanu\u2019s women\u2019s 49kg event is on the first day.",

Zou confirmed what everyone in the Bercy Arena already knew. The man from Yibin is in a class of his own on parallel bars. Scoring an incredible 16.200, the three-time world champion on the apparatus was just flawless during his routine to achieve the Olympic threepeat. \"I am so grateful for Paris providing the stage for us to show our gymnastics,\" said Zou. \"Most of us come here with injuries and it's not easy to perform in such conditions. But the crowd cheering us on and showing their enthusiasm has made things a lot different.\" Second-placed Kovtun is no slouch himself. The Ukrainian is also known as a parallel bars maestro.

She scored 14.366 ahead of Zhou Yaqin of the People's Republic of China, who posted a 14.100. D'Amato's teammate Manila Esposito was third with 14.000. No Italian woman had previously won an Olympic medal on the balance beam - or any individual event for that matter. Now the country owns two, with D'Amato covering her face in disbelief as her victory was confirmed. It's the first time that Italy has won an Olympic title in gymnastics in any event - male or female - since Athens 2004, when Igor Cassina claimed gold on the horizontal bar. Top qualifier Zhou was first to go but had to grab the beam to prevent a fall on a full-turning straight jump crossways on the beam. She scored just 14.100, down more than .700 from qualifying, opening the door for the field. What followed was a nervous final with falls from both Americans Simone Biles and Suni Lee - as well as others. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade went last and suffered no major errors, but her difficulty score was down .400 from the qualifying round. She'd finish fourth. D'Amato seized the opportunity, staying calm through a slight adjustment on her acrobatic series. Her victory adds to the team silver she helped Italy win a few days ago, a first for the country since 1928.",

Manika Batra won both her singles matches, while Archana Kamath and Sreeja Akula combined to win the doubles match. Earlier in the day, Sreeja Akula paired up with Archana Kamath to open India\u2019s campaign in a doubles contest against Romania\u2019s Adina Diaconu and Elizabeta Samara. The duo of Sreeja-Archana got the team off to a terrific start, wrapping up the match in straight games 3-0 (11-9, 12-10, 11-7) in 27 minutes. Manika Batra, world No. 28, was up against Bernadette Szocs, the European Games gold medallist in women\u2019s singles. Szocs, 10th in table tennis rankings, was off to a poor start with a string of unforced errors and never recovered, as the Indian table tennis player continued to build on the momentum. Manika Batra overcame her higher-ranked opponent with ease in straight games 3-0 (11-5, 11-7, 11-7) to give India a 2-0 lead. However, Romania fought back with consecutive victories to take the match to a decider.

Manika Batra took on the 61st-ranked Adina Diaconu in the decider and steered the team past the finish line. Manika won in straight games once again (11-5, 11-9, 11-9) to seal a 3-2 win for India. This is India\u2019s first appearance in the table tennis team events at the Olympics. In the quarter-finals, India will face the winner of the match between the USA and Germany.",

World No. 4 Australia scored through Alice Arnott (10\u2019) in the first quarter and Tatum Stewart (45\u2019) in the third quarter. China, ranked eighth, progressed to the semi-finals, courtesy of the goals from Ma Ning (11\u2019), Wan Den (20\u2019) and Jiaqi Zhong (35\u2019).

The Hockeyroos vs China match began evenly but the Aussies struck first in the 10th minute when Alice Arnott converted a penalty corner for her fourth goal of the tournament. She ended up Australia\u2019s highest goal-scorer at Paris 2024. China, the Asian Games champions, swiftly responded a minute later. Ma Ning's low drag-flick from a penalty corner beat Australian goalkeeper Jocelyn Bartram on the right and made it all square. China ramped up their offensive pressure in the second quarter. Their efforts paid off in the 20th minute when Wan Den skillfully manoeuvred past three Aussie defenders and the goalkeeper to tap in and make it 2-1. China used the flanks well and earned their fourth penalty corner of the match five minutes into the third quarter. Jocelyn Bartram made the save on the first shot but could not keep out Jiaqi Zhong\u2019s shot on the rebound. With their Olympic campaign on the line, the Hockeyroos responded with urgency and frequently penetrated the Chinese circle. They earned three penalty corners in the remaining minutes of the third quarter. Tatum Stewart successfully converted the third penalty corner and brought the deficit down to one goal. The Hockeyroos put China under tremendous pressure in the first five minutes of the final quarter. They earned four consecutive penalty corners but the Chinese defence stayed resolute and denied any space for Australia to score. Despite giving their all for the remainder of the game, the Australian women\u2019s hockey team could not find the back of the net and ultimately ended up on the losing side. The Hockeyroos are three-time Olympic champions but played their last semi-final at the Sydney 2000 Games. They went on to win the gold medal at the Sydney Games.

Tim Hellwig, Lisa Tertsch, Lasse Luehrs, and Laura Lindemann took home the gold for Germany in the second-ever edition of the Olympic triathlon mixed relay. The climax was nothing short of spectacular, ending in a three-way sprint to determine the podium. Germany\u2019s Lindemann delivered a breathtaking kick to the finish, securing the gold medal for her team. In an unforgettable photo finish, the United States edged out Great Britain for silver, leaving the defending Olympic champions with bronze. This victory was a redemption arc for Lindemann, who crashed in the individual event earlier in the week. \"I believed in myself and I just gave it my all. It's amazing. The team did such a great job and we deserved it,\" Lindemann said, still catching her breath after the race. Hellwig**,** who kicked off Germany's relay, was ecstatic about his teammate\u2019s performance. \"We know she has one of the strongest kicks in world triathlon, but you always have to pull it off on the biggest stage. We trusted in her, and she did the job in the end.\" Meanwhile, an equally thrilling race was happening just a few steps behind Lindemann for the remaining podium spots. The United States\u2019 Taylor Knibb, known for her cycling strength, moved her team from fifth to contend for the lead. Despite a series of crashes in the road time trial earlier in the week, Knibb's cycling was a game-changer in the mixed relay,a s she clocked the fastest split on the final leg. She caught up with Lindemann and Britain\u2019s Beth Potter on the bike and pushed ahead in the final transition. In the end, it was a photo finish that decided the silver and bronze medals.

The 22-year-old Vaast, with a score of 17.67, got the better of Australia\u2019s Jack Robinson in the final, who took silver with a score of 7.83. Brazil\u2019s Gabriel Medina took the bronze medal with a 15.54, improving on his fourth-place finish at Tokyo 2020.

All four women in the medal matches are returning Olympians, with all four improving \u2014 most notably Marks and Hennessy, who both just missed the podium in Tokyo. \"I\u2019m so happy. It feels so good \u2026 I was really emotional about not medalling in Tokyo, so I\u2019m going to stop talking now because I\u2019ll get emotional now that I know I\u2019m going to get one,\" Marks said to Olympics. com after advancing to the gold medal final. \"I sliced my foot a few times on the reef, so I\u2019m glad it worked out.

She earned her 7.0 in a clean frontside barrel, which saw her exit and carve back to finish, snapping a crisp hammer off the lip to close out a winning wave. Heat 2 saw Weston-Webb use full rail turns and some excellent frontside tube riding to post the day's highest single wave score of 8.33 and a total heat score of 13.66 to win the semi-final heat over Hennessy. An accidental priority mishap in the heat effectively ended Hennessy\u2019s chances, as she was penalized for the violation. Her heat ended with a single-wave score of 6.17.",

It was a full-circle moment for the star of the Dutch team, who never imagined himself on this stage as a kid. \u201cI never grew up with a dream to play in the Olympics,\u201d said De Jong. \u201cIf anything I wanted to play in the NBA or just get the best out of me. The reason why I started in the first place was because I wanted to see if I could have been better than my dad.\u201d He added: \u201cIt has been an extremely long journey, I switched from five-on-five to 3x3 because I couldn\u2019t get the joy from five-on-five anymore. I lost it along the way, and to be able to find it in 3x3 and then for it to take me here to this moment, it\u2019s undescribable.\u201d De Jong led the Dutch team on the court, spiritually and physically, in the final. He netted seven points total, including a slam dunk that set the tone early in the game. While his two point shots missed left and right in regulation, he found nothing but net when it mattered in overtime, securing a dramatic victory for the men in orange. \u201cI left it up to the gods and just a little bit of luck,\u201d said De Jong. \u201cYou work your whole career to actually make those shots, but you throw it off, fading away\u2026 it\u2019s a tough shot to make, but it went in and here we stand.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t win the gold medal by himself. His performance was accompanied by vital ball control, shooting and defense from Jan Driessen, Dimeo van der Horst and Arvin Slagter. Slagter was dominant in the key, snagging five defensive rebounds against the French. His defensive performance was complemented by Driessen, who collected three offensive rebounds and netted six points for the Dutch. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe this. It is an unbelievable feeling,\u201d said Slagter. He joined his teammates in a victorious embrace on the podium, singing the national anthem as they watched the Netherlands\u2019 flag ascend the flagpole at La Concorde.",

The 25-year-old Indian wrestler, who was competing with heavy strappings on her right hand, lost 10-8 to the 18-year-old Pak Sol Gum of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea in the quarter-finals. Pak Sol Gum later lost to the USA\u2019s Amit Elor in the women\u2019s 68kg freestyle semi-finals via technical superiority, ending Nisha\u2019s chance to earn a bronze medal through the repechage round. Dahiya, the silver medallist at the 2023 Asian Championships, started strongly in her quarter-final bout. The Indian wrestler secured an early lead of 8-2 but had to take medical timeouts for her injured hand. Battling through the pain and intense emotions, she switched to a defensive strategy to protect her advantage. However, Pak Sol Gum seized the opportunity, scoring eight consecutive points to secure her place in the wrestling semi-finals. After the match, Nisha was taken to a medical facility inside the Games Village for a scan. It was later learned that Nisha sustained a severe shoulder injury. \"The course of her treatment will be planned after further tests are performed,\" the Indian Olympic Association said in a statement. In her opening bout, Nisha Dahiya pulled off a late 6-4 win over fifth-seeded Tetiana Rizhko of Ukraine. Nisha made the first attacking move and earned a point after attempting an early takedown. However, Rizhko mounted a comeback with two 2-pointers and 4-1 after the first round. Nisha picked up two points within 10 seconds of the second round and got one more on the board after Rizhko stepped out. The scores remained 4-4 before Nisha turned the tables with 11 seconds to go and won the contest 6-4.

It has just been amazing to be a part of this and to finally come away with the gold, it means everything.\u201d Hodgkinson sought to avoid another second place finish at the Olympics, after finishing runner-up at Tokyo 2020. She didn\u2019t put a foot wrong in the final, doing everything within her power to claim the gold medal in front of 80,000 spectators at the Stade de France. \u201cYou just have to be consistent and hope that one day your time\u2019s going to come. And today was that day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what better way to do it than at the Olympics? I\u2019ve even lost my voice. Just talking and just excitement, everything, it has been incredible and something I\u2019ll remember the rest of my life.\u201d Her race will certainly be studied for decades to come by runners looking to repeat her success at the Olympic Games. The 22-year-old from Manchester ran a confident first turn, breaking for the inside of the track in a controlled manner that placed her near the front of the race with 600m remaining. She casually manoeuvred around the outside of Duguma to take control of the race with 500m to go, gradually building her stride towards the climax of the race. Hodgkinson held off advances from Moraa, Duguma and South Africa\u2019s Prudence Sekgodiso on the back straight to retain the lead heading into the home stretch, where she ran away from the rest of the field to stamp her authority on the women\u2019s 800m. \u201cI feel like you have to believe right from the start, but you never know how it\u2019s going to go,\u201d said Hodgkinson. \u201cIt was a little bit slower than I thought it was going to be. But I just had to trust myself. \u201cHopefully it will sink in tomorrow that I am the Olympic champion, but I can\u2019t wait to stand on that podium and listen to my national anthem for once and just really soak in the moment.\u201d",

For the 29-year-old Allman, it's the second Olympic gold on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, having also won this event at Tokyo 2020. Allman fouled on her first attempt of the competition as the discus landed outside of the boundaries. She immediately responded by taking the lead on her second try with a throw of 68.74m. This number alone would have won the event, but she bested it on her fourth attempt with the winning throw of 69.50m. Allman holds the USA national record at 71.46m and is now the fourth woman ever to win two Olympic gold medals in discus. \"In discus, there's so few people that get to do it as a profession. To do this full time, it is an honor,\" she said. \"It takes a lot of devotion, too, but I think in my journey, it's kind of just been finding the right people that believed in me at the right time, that saw far more potential than I saw myself, and letting the story unfold in a way that I only could have dreamed of.\" Feng Bin of the People\u2019s Republic of China and Sandra Elkasevic of Croatia earned silver and bronze, respectively, with both throwing a distance of 67.51m. \u201cThe distance was so-so, but to win my first Olympic medal is something I\u2019m very happy about,\" Feng said. \"I expected to throw about 68 metres to 69 metres, but I had some issues about two weeks before the meet and it affected my power a little. But maybe I\u2019m just finding excuses for myself. \"I lost a bit of sleep last night. Still some nerves. I probably rate myself 80 out of 100. The remaining 20 points, I lost it by not being able to get myself to the top.\" Elkasevic, a three-time Olympic medalist, echoed a similar sentiment of pride despite being slighty disappointed. \u201cI am amazed because this is my third medal after the gold in Rio and London. After being fourth in Tokyo, I am back. I threw my season's best,\" she said. \"It was a very hard competition. I want to enjoy this moment and I can\u2019t wait to come back at Los Angeles 2028. \"I know my throw of 67.51 is the same as Feng. She was second with this one.

This is the ninth time Duplantis has broken the world record, beating the mark of 6.24m he set in the Xiamen Diamond League in April this year. \u201cI haven\u2019t processed how fantastic that moment was,\" he said after his historic jump. \"It\u2019s one of those things that don\u2019t really feel real, such an out-of-body experience.

As chants of \u201cMondo, Mondo, Mondo\u201d rang around the stadium, Duplantis did what he does best, first breaking the Olympic record with a jump of 6.10m and then raising the bar higher to 6.25m. As he flew over the bar, he was met with roars from across the masses of people inside the Stade de France who had witnessed the greatest jump \u2014 and jumper \u2014 in history. \u201cI tried to clear my thoughts as much as I could,\" he said of the momentous reception he received from the stands. \"The crowd was going crazy. It was so loud in there, it sounded like an American football game. I have a little bit of experience being in a 100,000-capacity stadium, but I was never the centre of attention. [I was] just trying to channel the energy everybody was giving me, and they were giving me a lot of it. It worked out.\u201d With the screams of joy from the crowd only matched by Duplantis' own, the 24-year-old jumped from the mat and straight into the arms of his loved ones. On a night filled with unforgettable moments, this is one that will be talked about for years to come. His gold medal in Paris continues his incredible streak at major international outdoor championships, which has seen him win gold at the past three worlds and \u2014 after Monday \u2014 the last two Olympic Games.

Chebet produced a devastating kick over the final stretch to beat compatriot Faith Kipyegon to the line with a winning time of 14 minutes, 28.56 seconds (14:28.56). Kipyegon, who finished second, was initially disqualified for obstruction following an incident between her and Ethiopia\u2019s Gudaf Tsegay with two laps to go. Following an appeal, World Athletics confirmed that she had been reinstated as the silver medallist. Tokyo 2020 champion Sifan Hassan finished third in 14:30.61 with Italy\u2019s Nadia Battocletti finishing fourth with a national record of 14:31.64. The race was billed as the battle of the three fastest women in history over the distance with defending champion Hassan, reigning world champion Kipyegon and world record holder Tsegay going toe-to-toe. Chebet delivered a well-measured run over the 12-and-a-half laps before a climactic conclusion with a sprint to the line against former world record-holder Kipyegon. The two-time world medallist not only etched her name into the history books but sank the trio\u2019s hopes of adding the 5,000m to their respective multiple gold medal attempts at these Games. Chebet and Kipyegon were among the front runners along with Tsegay for the majority of the race with Hassan biding her time at the back before she moved up the field in the closing stages. As the race entered the business end with two laps to go there was a bit of pushing and shoving between Kipyegon and Tsegay before the latter moved to the front. But Tsegay\u2019s run at the front was short-lived as Kipyegon made her move with 500m to go with Chebet in tow. Chebet pulled ahead with 50m to go racing across the line adding the Olympic gold to her silver and bronze from the world championships.",

US star Thomas will back into the blocks on Tuesday\u2019s final as one of the favourites after posting the fastest times in both the heats and semi-final rounds. Thomas, who came into the Games boasting the fastest time over the half-lap this year, won her heat stopping the clock at 21.86 seconds.

Moments before then the 13-year-old was staring down her third and final run attempt. Having tripped over the same trick on the previous two tries, this was the last chance to stake her claim on the women\u2019s park skateboarding event. Dropping in and stomping the kickflip indy that had troubled her on her previous goes, she ripped around the bowl finishing off the rest of the run. When it was over the young Briton punched the air with both arms before dropping down with her hands behind her head in relief. She had done it. As had become customary throughout the contest, the rest of the field came over to hug her in celebration. The jubilant scenes that followed sealed the park contest as an Olympic memory few would ever forget. The connected energy of skateboarding, debuting at the Games, touched the lives of millions tuning in in the middle of the pandemic looking for light relief. And who could not smile watching a 13-year-old who had refused to quit be rewarded with a medal? Sitting for an interview with Olympics.com ahead of Paris 2024, it\u2019s clear the same infectiously positive energy that radiated from Brown then, is still present now. Three years older and roughly two inches taller she is quite obviously different from the young shredder that first inspired a generation of Britons to pick up a skateboard after making history in Tokyo. \u201cI am older, a little more experienced, a little taller, a little bigger. I've been training a lot so I think I definitely got stronger and more powerful,\u201d Brown reflects, listing the main differences between her then and now. \u201cI think I've grown and I think I've grown in skateboarding too.\u201d",

Over the past three years as the Games have shifted from Tokyo towards Paris, there has been a significant shuffle of the deck as newcomers have come and disrupted establishment figures. The USA men\u2019s park is one such example, with no skaters from Tokyo 2020 returning to Paris. Instead, it will fall on world number one Tate Carew, world champion Gavin Bottger and vert sensation Tom Schaar to deliver for the skateboarding powerhouse.

So, when her final artistic gymnastics routine of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in the beam final didn\u2019t go her way, Lee said she was focusing on the bigger picture. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of things to be proud of this time around, just because I had to overcome so much,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThere were days where I was fighting demons, and [my coach] Jess [Graba] was just like, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t even know if this is for you anymore.\u2019 \u201cThere were times where he was like, \u2018Maybe you should just be done here,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI was having the worst times.\u201d Having persevered, Lee\u2019s three medals make six total in her career at the Olympic Games. At Tokyo 2020, she was the all-around champion along with grabbing team silver and uneven bars bronze. Her experience in Paris could not have been more different than that in Japan, says Lee, crediting those closest to her for changing her perspective. \u201cI feel like a lot of it, too, was just kind of finding myself, just because I used to be very introverted. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anybody, like super shy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think just being around the right people and having my coaches by my side, always joking, laughing with me and making feel comfortable inside the gym and enjoying my time there and me being able to express that I was enjoying my time, helped a lot.\u201d Her six medals puts her tied with Aly Raisman for third most by an American gymnast at the Olympics behind Simone Biles (11) and Shannon Miller (7). \u201cAll the medals mean something super special to me,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with how it went.\u201d",

In fact, more than fine. The 27-year-old led the American women back to the team title at the outset of the artistic gymnastics event before she captured a second individual all-around crowd, eight years after her first and gold on vault. Biles' third Olympics came to an end on Monday (5 August) with a silver medal on floor, runner-up to an inspired Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who had pushed Biles to the brink in the all-around. It marked the completion of one of the greatest bouncebacks in Olympic history - both figuratively and literally. \"I've accomplished way more than in my wildest dreams,\" Biles told a packed press conference room. \"Not just at this Olympics, but in the sport.\" \"A couple years ago, I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympic Games,\" she continued. \"So competing and then walking away with four medals... I'm not mad about it. I'm pretty proud of myself.\" Cameras inside Bercy Arena even caught American football great Tom Brady with his hands clasped over his face seemingly in disbelief. Even if it was an opportune snap, the sentiment was certain: Greatness witnessing greatness - and in awe of it, too. Brady was just one of countless celebrities to show up these Games to see Biles, including Serena Williams, Ariana Grande, Tom Cruise and many, many more. Biles showed them all - and the rest of the Olympic audience - what gymnastics fans already knew: She was, indeed, back.",

The 24-year-old will compete in the women\u2019s 100m hurdles event which gets underway on August 7. Yarraji, an Asian Games silver medallist, first broke the women\u2019s 100m hurdles national record after clocking 13.23s in Cyprus in May 2022 and has improved it several times since then. The current record stands at 12.78s which she achieved in Chengdu, the People\u2019s Republic of China in August 2023. Yarraji couldn\u2019t meet the direct entry standard of 12.77s by a whisker and qualified for the Paris 2024 on the basis of her ranking. The Indian hurdler was ranked 34th by the cutoff period with the top 40 athletes making it to the Summer Games. She has logged a season\u2019s best of 12.78s, just 0.01 seconds short of the qualifying standard, after matching her national record-setting performance in Finland in May this year. Masai Russell of the USA has been in red-hot form this season. She clocked 12.25s in Oregon in June, which moved her to fourth-fastest in the all-time list. The 24-year-old will be a serious contender for the title at Paris 2024. Former world champion and three-time Diamond League winner Tobi Amusan of Nigeria will be among those to challenge for the gold medal. She is also the current world record holder in this event after clocking 12.12s in Eugene, Oregon in 2022. Russell and Amusan are expected to face a stiff challenge from Jamaica\u2019s Ackera Nugent. The 22-year-old set a national record at the 2024 Jamaican Championships, clocking a time of 12.28s. Nugent is the world U20 champion from 2021. Cyrena Samba-Mayela, of host nation France, is also expected to be in the fray after posting an impressive win at the 2024 European Championships in Rome. She set a championship and national record of 12.31s. The women\u2019s 100m hurdles event at Paris 2024 will begin with the first round of heats on August 7.

At La Chapelle Arena, Lakshya Sen, 22nd in the badminton rankings, suffered a 13-21, 21-16, 21-11 loss to world No. 7 Lee Zii Jia in 71 minutes. The 22-year-old Sen failed to become the first Indian badminton player to win an Olympic medal in the men\u2019s event. Despite outclassing his opponent in the first game, Sen conceded eight straight points to 26-year-old Lee Zii Jia to lose the second game. He couldn\u2019t mentally recover in the third game and the Malaysian dictated the rallies in the decider to win the bronze medal at Paris 2024. Sen also struggled with a bruise to his right forearm which bled and had to be taped for most of the contest. Lakshya Sen, the reigning Commonwealth champion, began the contest with a 6-2 lead with his opponent making unforced errors early on. The Indian also made use of the court dimensions well and with line calls going in his favour, he went into the break with an 11-5 lead. With the score at 17-12, Sen won four of the next five points to comfortably take the first game and put Lee Zii Jia under pressure. The second game began with the Indian playing a sensational cross-court smash and kept pushing to make the score 7-2. But Lee Zii Jia bounced back and won five consecutive points to restore parity at 8-8. The Malaysian continued to press forward and went into the break with an 11-8 lead to put Sen on the backfoot. Lakshya Sen finally put an end to Lee Zii Jia\u2019s advances and made it 12-9 to bring himself back into the contest and then made things level at 12-12. The two players continued to match each other point-for-point. However, the five minutes of poor play from Lakshya Sen that allowed Lee Zii Jia to take charge of the contest ended up costing him and the Malaysian forced a deciding game. Lee Zii Jia dictated the rallies early on in the third game and surged to a 9-2 lead. With his back to the wall, Sen played a cross-court smash to make it 9-3. The world No. 7, however, led by five points, with the scoreboard reading 11-6 at the interval. He then stretched the lead to 16-8. Sen could hardly recover from that deficit and went on to lose the match. This was Lakshya Sen\u2019s second loss against the Malaysian. He had beaten Lee Zii Jia at the All England Open earlier this year. Lakshya Sen entered the bronze medal match after suffering a heartbreaking loss to Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in the last four. In the quarter-finals, the unseeded Lakshya Sen defeated Chinese Taipei\u2019s Chou Tien-chen in a hard-fought three-game encounter. As a result, he became the first Indian shuttler to reach the badminton men\u2019s singles semi-finals at the Summer Games. Parupalli Kashyap and Kidambi Srikanth previously reached the quarter-finals at London 2012 and Rio 2016, respectively. Lakshya Sen, on his Olympic debut, topped his men\u2019s singles group, by beating reigning All England champion and world No. 4 Jonatan Christie. He also got the better of his compatriot HS Prannoy in the round of 16.",

The most decorated Brazilian athlete at the Olympic Games added a gold medal Monday afternoon (5 August), claiming the women's floor title at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 . It's a second Olympic gold for Andrade, the Tokyo 2020 vaulting champion. She has six total medals in her three Olympic appearances. Andrade told media earlier this week that Paris could be her career floor finale. \"I am very happy and proud about what I did,\" she said. \"We came here every day to compete and perform (well). Gymnastics is not an easy sport, it requires a lot from our body and mind. \"I was confident I was able to manage all of the pressure and I worked with my coach in order to achieve what we've done.\" Andrade's 14.166 was just ahead of Simone Biles (14.133). Biles' American teammate Jordan Chiles was third, scoring a 13.766 after a scoring inquiry lifted her from fifth to the podium. It's the 11th Olympic medal for Biles, extending her record as the most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast. The Brazilian star tumbled a front layout full to full-in and a full-twisting double layout to open. She closed with a controlled double pike. Andrade took her time coming off the podium, savouring the appreciation from the crowd. When the final scores flashed inside Bercy Arena, the 25-year-old artistic gymnastics star seemed stunned during an embrace with coach. In the warm-up, Biles looked cautious. She has been dealing with a strained calf injury throughout the Games and struggled through her signature triple-double (Biles II) in the moments before she competed. But in competition, that tumbling pass gave her no trouble. Instead, Biles flew out of bounds with both feet on her second and fourth tumbling passes, incurring a .600 total neutral deduction. \"Obviously wasn't my best performances, but at the end of the day, whoever medaled, medaled and that's what's so exciting because you just never know with gymnastics,\" said Biles afterward. \"So I'm not very upset or anything about my performance at the Olympics. I'm actually very happy, proud and even more excited about it.\" Chiles' score was originally 13.666 but coaches Laurent and Cecile Landi filed an inquiry. It was accepting, raising her difficulty score by .1 and giving her the bronze medal. \"I didn't even realize my coaches put in an inquiry, and I was like, 'Okay, yeah. Like, let's see... it can vary,'\" explained Chiles. \"So when it came through, I was very proud of myself. It was my first event final and my first event medal. This is crazy.\"",

By night's end, they were celebrating the Olympic gold won by their charge, Keely Hodgkinson in the women's 800m at Olympic Games Paris 2024. So thrilling, so not normal. And that base of normality while eyeing greatness appears to be the key to success for the Brit, after finally claiming the gold medal she craved after winning two world silver medals and Olympic silver at Tokyo 2020. The basis of normality tinged with uniqueness is also how the celebrations unfolded. \"I joined my family at a bar somewhere,\" Hodgkinson said in a press conference early the following morning having managed to get to bed in the early hours. \"It was great. The atmosphere was absolutely [amazing]... I'm really, really happy. It was nice to celebrate with them.\" And yet, the Hodgkinson is also an elite athlete who has just expended every sinew of energy and every molecule of mental capacity in achieving her quest of winning Olympic gold. Emotionally and physically spent, Hodgkinson was first to leave the party. The first time she had time to think, to begin to process what she'd just done, was four o'clock in the morning. \"I finally had a moment to myself and I rewatched the race back. It was really good to see and just listen to the commentary, just have so many incredible people supporting me. Yeah, it was just surreal. I think it will take a while to sink in.\"",

Arshad Nadeem, the 2023 World Championships silver medallist, recorded an 86.59m throw on his first attempt to achieve the direct qualification mark of 84m. However, the headlines belonged to the Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Neeraj who achieved a monster throw of 89.34m on his first attempt. \"It gives me immense joy that there are only two of us from South Asia, myself and Neeraj bhai, who are performing on the world stage along with the other players who compete with Neeraj,\u201d Arshad noted. \"I hope that we continue to perform for our respective countries and make the names of our countries shine bright globally.\" The men\u2019s javelin throw final is scheduled for August 8 and will take place at the Stade de France in Paris. Neeraj was crowned Olympic champion at Tokyo 2020 with an 87.58m throw. The 27-year-old Arshad Nadeem finished fifth in that event with a throw of 84.62m. He is the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event in the history of the Olympics. \u201cAt every competition, the aim of every athlete remains to try and perform to the best of their ability. I wish Neeraj the best of luck. May he and I both do well for our respective countries,\u201d said Nadeem when asked about the prospect of sharing the Olympic podium with India\u2019s Neeraj Chopra. The Indo-Pakistani duo had shared the podium at the 2018 Asian Games where Neeraj won the gold while Nadeem won bronze. More recently, at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, Neeraj won the gold medal and shared the podium with Arshad Nadeem who took silver. They also share a friendship and mutual respect for each other with the two even interacting at the Olympic Village in Paris. \"Yes, we have met each other a few times there. We have a bit of a chat every time we meet,\u201d said the Pakistani javelin ace. \"And we spoke just now as well, and he said congratulations to me after the qualification. \u201cUsually, we speak about things that friends talk about. The usual stuff. And we wish each other that we do well for our respective countries,\" added the Commonwealth Games champion.",

The 30-year-old Bol made his Olympic debut at Rio 2016. He finished sixth in his heat with a time of 1:49.36. At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, however, he finished first in his semi-final and set what was then a national record of 1:44.11. Although he has improved his personal best to 1:44.00 at the Paris Diamond League in 2022, the national record of 1:43.99 in 800m currently belongs to Joseph Deng. In the men\u2019s 800m final at Tokyo 2020, Bol finished fourth and missed the bronze medal by 0.53s. His fourth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was the highest finish by an Australian male in an individual track event since Darren Clark's fourth in the 400m in 1988. Bol is now competing in his third Olympics in Paris. At Paris 2024, the men\u2019s 800m athletics event starts on August 7 with round 1, which comprises six heats. Peter Bol is in heat 4. The top three in each heat advance to the semi-final, while the remaining finishers progress to the repechage round, held on the following day. The men\u2019s 800m semi-final is on August 9 and the final is on August 11 (wee hours on August 12 in Australia). Peyton Craig and Joseph Deng are the other Australian athletes competing in the 800m. None of the Tokyo 2020 medal winners are in the 800m entry list for Paris 2024. However, the field has world champion Marco Arop of Canada and Kenya\u2019s Emmanuel Wanyonyi, the Diamond League winner.",

Playing at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium on Monday, the Hockeyroos lost 3-2 for the side\u2019s third straight exit in the quarter-finals of the Olympic Games. The 31-year-old Claxton, a three-time Olympian, was part of the squad in each of those three campaigns. The three-time Olympic champions are yet to win a medal since winning the gold at Sydney 2000. The match against China was also Claxton\u2019s 250th appearance for the Hockeyroos. She had served as the co-captain of Australia at Paris 2024 along with Brooke Peris, Kaitlin Nobbs and Grace Stewart. Following the team\u2019s elimination, Jane Claxton said that she was satisfied with the team\u2019s campaign given the injury issues that they have had to deal with. \"We had a lot of injuries. Unfortunately (we) came out of the (Great Britain) game with quite a few body contacts that resulted in injuries. We had to manage that throughout with girls playing in different positions,\u201d Claxton said. \u201cThe young girls went out there and played some amazing hockey. So overall, I'm proud of our performances,\u201d she said. \"If we'd gotten through this match, I do believe we could have been on the podium. But unfortunately, quarterfinals are like that,\" she added. Claxton has been a part of three Commonwealth Games medal-winning Australian teams, including the side that won gold at Glasgow 2014. She is also a Hockey World Cup silver medallist and also won the bronze medal in 2022.",

Playing at the Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille, the Opals, ranked third, beat world No. 10 Serbia 87-65. Alanna Smith led the charge for Australia and scored 22 points while George Cayla and Jade Melbourne also contributed with 18 points each. Serbia, Olympic bronze medallists at Rio 2016, were no match for Australia despite Jovana Nogic, who scored 17 points, trying her best in this game. Australia, the five-time Olympic medallists, will face either Nigeria or the USA in the semi-finals on August 9. The Opals will be playing in the last four of the women\u2019s basketball event at the Summer Games for the first time since London 2012. On that occasion, they lost to eventual winners USA in the semi-finals before clinching the bronze against Russia. The Serbian basketball team was the first to get on the scoreboard with Jovana Nogic scoring a two-pointer but Steph Talbot got the Opals on the scoreboard shortly after to make it 2-2. Australia took a 10-6 lead with Alanna Smith netting consecutive two-pointers. With Serbia closing in in the final minutes of the first quarter, George Cayla proved decisive and helped the Opals take a 26-19 lead at the end of the first quarter. Australia stretched the lead to 31-19 in the early exchanges of the second quarter and despite Serbia\u2019s best efforts to try to close down the gap, they led 40-25 five minutes before half-time. Jade Melbourne grabbed a couple of two-pointers while Cayla made two free throws which allowed the Opals to take a 48-32 lead at half-time. Serbia were no match for Australia in the third quarter as the Opals kicked into a higher gear. Smith made it 50-35 and stretched the lead to 64-39 in a matter of minutes. Just two minutes before the end of the quarter, Jade Melbourne made it 72-45 with the help of two free throws but Serbia took three points in the final seconds to close the quarter trailing Australia 72-45. Australia continued to maintain their superiority in the first half of the final quarter and stopped any advances from the Serbian side. Protecting a 22-point lead in the final minutes, the Opals were hardly put in a place of discomfort. In the end, they held on to win 85-67 and make it to the last four of the Paris 2024 Olympics basketball tournament.",

The 19-year-old from the United States will enter the men\u2019s park skateboarding event at Paris 2024 as the world\u2019s number one ranked skater owing to an impressive collection of results from the past two years. In the six Olympic qualifiers he entered ahead of the Games, Carew never once finished below sixth place; claiming three podium finishes and a contest victory at the first stop of the Olympic Qualifier Series in Shanghai. Very few have been as consistent as Carew but it isn\u2019t just the numbers that have made the U.S. skater a point of focus for those looking for potential medallists in the men\u2019s park field in Paris. In a podcast episode published earlier this year, legendary skateboard star Tony Hawk recounted a story of having identified something special in the skater when watching him at work in an early Olympic qualifier. \u201cI was watching a qualifying run like two years ago and it was some [Chris] Gregson footage, you know, he\u2019s there and whatever on some story. And I just wrote, \u2019Tate, Paris 2024\u2019,\u201d Hawk said in a conversation with Jason Ellis and Carew\u2019s Olympic teammate Tom Schaar. \u201cI saw it,\" Hawk confirmed. \"I think he\u2019ll do well.\u201d It prompted Hawk to take a further interest in Carew with his brand sponsoring the U.S. skater and turning him 'professional' over a week before the Games started. Sitting for an interview with Olympics.com not long after his victory in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Carew seemed comfortable recounting his winning moment. But there is a notable shift when shared how it felt to hear Hawk's words recounted back to him. \u201cSomeone told me six or seven months ago that that interaction had happened between Chris Gregson and Tony and I kind of just\u2026 I didn\u2019t really know what to say because, at the time, I wasn\u2019t that close to Chris and also I didn\u2019t ride for Tony, but it was so crazy to hear it,\u201d Carew said. \u201cAnd then hearing it again on the podcast and hearing Tom, and they all talked about it\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to feel.

The first semi-final saw the Netherlands face Spain in a winner-take-all showdown for the right to play for gold. The men in orange emerged victorious, winning 4-0 in dominant fashion. It was a difficult loss for the Spanish team, which will need to rebound from the setback if they want to join the Netherlands on the podium by winning the bronze-medal match, also slated for Thursday. The other semi-final saw an even more bitter loss for India, whose gold-medal dreams slipped away in the final minutes against Germany, who prevailed 3-2.",

Hundreds of people had gathered just outside the exit by the stands, penned back by temporarily erected metal barriers to keep them from forming an uncontained mass. Eyes darted around as fans looked to see what was causing the latest movement. An eagerness hummed in the air. They were waiting to catch a glimpse of the newest Olympic stars. The protagonists in question were, of course, the teen trio of Arisa Trew, Hiraki Cocona and Sky Brown. The oldest of them only a month past her 16th birthday, they had just delivered a skate final for the books. World number one Hiraki of Japan set herself up as the one to chase after putting down a statement 91.98 on her opening run. Brown, Trew and the rest of the pack duly tried to challenge, and the pair got close. The Australian Trew produced a 90.11 score and Britain's Brown a 91.60 with their second runs. But it would be in the final round that the trio would truly come alive. With her final go, Trew landed an imperious line peppered with 540s and a stunning front nose blunt on the box grab 180 out to finish. The 14-year-old grinned as she popped out of the bowl, her smile as striking as her statement hot-pink helmet. Skateboarding legend Tony Hawk, watching on the edge of the bowl, raised his hands above his head and clapped, knowing that with that effort Trew would become the leader. And, sure enough, she climbed to the top with a 93.18 score. Brown and Hiraki subsequently took their turns in response, but neither were quite able to improve on their lot. Applause rained down and tears of joy flowed as the final concluded. Hiraki ended up with silver and Brown took bronze. It was dramatic, special, a sight worthy of the iconic landmarks that littered the skyline behind them. But it was also much more than that.",

        "document": "Marta's dream of an Olympic gold is not over yet. When she was given her marching orders against Spain in the group stages, receiving a straight red card for a high-foot challenge, many thought this was where her incredible legacy ended. Brazil came into the knockout rounds at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 as the dark horses, having qualified as one of the best-ranked third-place teams. But with an emphatic win over hosts France in the quarter-finals, they found themselves in a semi-final showpiece against reigning world champions and Olympic debutants Spain. The South Americans went 2-0 up in the first half after a dominant showing, with the opener a gift from a Spanish mishap at the back, before Gabi Portilho doubled their advantage. Twenty minutes from the end, Adriana capped a simply stunning display from Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, sending them through to the gold medal match with a blistering 4-2 victory. Spain looked to inspire a comeback late on by adding their name to the scoresheet twice, but a fourth from Kerolin affirmed her side's spot in the next round. Their win means that Marta, who is a two-time silver medallist with her national team, will get one last chance to fight for gold in what will be her farewell to the Games. It is her sixth time representing Brazil at the Olympics, in what is her final major international tournament as she intends to retire at the end of the year. What a story that has unfolded in Paris, and what a fitting farewell to the global stage for Marta. Four-time champions, the USWNT, stand in their way on Saturday, 10 August.",

Morris made history and sealed his Olympic berth on 2 April, at the 2024 IWF World Cup in Phuket, Thailand when he famously set a world record of 176 kilograms (388 pounds) clean and jerk in the 61kg weight class, breaking the record previously held by Li. His total for the day was 303, combining his snatch of 127kg and his record 176kg clean and jerk. It won him gold in the clean and jerk category, but it wasn\u2019t enough to win the overall event. That honour went to Li, his primary challenger in the 61kg category. At that same event, Li strengthened his hold on first place, setting a new snatch world record of 146kg (321.8 pounds). Morris is set to face off against Li again among the field of 10 men competing in the 61kg weight class in Paris.

The 26-year-old became the first athlete to repeat as Olympic long jump champion in the 21st century, doing so with exceptional speed, power and technique. \u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement,\u201d said Tentoglou. \u201cI am very happy, but very tired. It\u2019s OK. My distance was not bad, not good.\u201d He added: \u201cI wanted to do a little bit more, but it\u2019s an Olympic final. I had a lot of pressure. I think I managed to do good jumps, all my jumps were good. So I\u2019m happy.\" Italy\u2019s Mattia Furlani got the competition off to a thrilling start, jumping 8.34m to take the early lead. His reign over the pit wouldn\u2019t last long, however, as Tentoglou and Jamaica\u2019s Wayne Pinnock turned up the heat in the second round of jumps. Pinnock took the lead first, leaping 8.36m to better Furlani by 0.02m. Tentoglou then jumped further, soaring to a mark of 8.48m to surpass Pinnock\u2019s mark by 0.12m. All three jumpers would attempt to improve their marks over the next four rounds of competition, but their original marks would prove decisive at the Stade de France. \u201cI didn\u2019t think my jump was going to be enough because the other guys are very talented and capable,\u201d said Tentoglou. \u201cI was pushing throughout to do more.\u201d Pinnock echoed Tentoglou\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cHonestly, I wanted to go further. It\u2019s just the mindset, you have to stay focused. When it comes to pressure, when someone puts a big jump out there, you just have to stay focused. I was trying to push too early. I was getting too excited. But it goes like that sometimes.\u201d Still, he was very pleased to earn a silver medal for all the work he has put into training for the event. \u201cI was hurt a couple of months ago,\u201d said Pinnock. \u201cI never lost hope. I always stayed positive. I\u2019m not going to lie, it was a tough journey coming back. But as I said, I never lost hope. I prayed about it. And I\u2019m an Olympic silver medallist right now.\u201d Nineteen-year-old Furlani was overjoyed to share the podium with Tentoglou and Pinnock. He overcame a lack of experience at the senior level to stun the spectators at the Stade de France with his brilliant leaps well past 8m. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, with my parents\u2019 support, with this stadium. It\u2019s a dream,\u201d said Furlani. \u201cI live the dream every day. With dedication, work and belief, I\u2019m here with this medal.\u201d It was a true family affair for Furlani, with his mother acting as his coach in the long jump. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy because on the track, with my little work with my mother, I dreamed of this medal with her, and now I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d added Furlani. His name, along with Tentoglou and Pinnock, will be recorded in the annals of Olympic history after a night of sensational jumping at the Stade de France.",

But how many kids do you reckon picture themselves not only being an Olympian, but winning Olympic gold WITH A WORLD RECORD? That's even beyond the scope of a little kid, isn't it? Apparently not. A young Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis, famed for the pole-vault track and equipment his father set up in their family's back garden, did just that, he told Olympics.com the day after making his dream come true on Monday, 5 August at Paris 2024 with a height of 6.25 metres to break his own world record. \"I think I visualised this exact situation happening a thousand times in my head,\" said the American-born athlete who represents Sweden. \"I mean, I feel like that was almost every time I went out to the backyard and I would jump, I think I would visualise this exact situation.

But not like this. Not with 80,000 spectators roaring you on at the giddiest of Olympic Games at the iconic Stade de France, which has seen its fair share of dramatic moments.

I thought you could do that. I lived with my nan and she does everything for me, so I'm just spoilt.\" Six years later and I check in on his cooking skills. Hudson-Smith said: \"You see, Noah dropped me in it. I did nothing, I had everything catered towards me. So now that I've got YouTube and I learnt and I think I'm a decent cook.

The reigning world champion underlined her status as the sport\u2019s new star becoming the first athlete from America to win the women\u2019s hammer since it was first introduced at the Olympics in Sydney 2000. Poland has dominated the event winning four of the last six editions with world record holder Anita Wlodarczyk accounting for three of those. Rogers leapfrogged Annette Nneka Echikunwoke of the United States with her fifth-round heave of 76.97 metres to claim the title. Echikunwoke settled for silver thanks to her third-round throw of 75.48m with Zhao Jie of the People\u2019s Republic of China bagging bronze with 74.27m. Rogers\u2019 victory came just days after compatriot Ethan Katzberg won the men\u2019s hammer throw event. In doing so, Canada became only the second nation after Poland to win both men\u2019s and women\u2019s hammer gold medals at the same Olympics. Rogers made more history as the third athlete ever to win a gold medal in a women\u2019s athletics event since Amsterdam 1928.",

Reigning Olympic champion and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone will go head-to-head with the reigning world champion Femke Bol in the final of the women's 400m hurdles, after both women posted sub-53 times in Tuesday's (6 August) semi-final round. But both McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol have gone under 51 seconds in recent weeks, with McLaughlin-Levrone lowering her own world record at the U.S. Olympic Trials in late June with a 50.65 and Bol running a 50.95 on 14 July in Switzerland. Neither star athlete was pushed too hard in her respective heat, the American going 52.13 in the second semi, while Bol claimed the third and final semi in 52.67. McLaughlin-Levrone's teammate Anna Cockrell was the only other semi-finallist to break the 53-second mark, going 52.90 to give Bol a push down the straightaway. France's Louise Maraval got the loudest cheer of the night, the home hope surging after the final hurdle to book a place in her first Olympic final, her 53.83 still well back of McLaughlin-Levrone. It's set to be the first match-up of McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol since the World Championships in 2022, when Sydney lowered the world record for a fourth time in her career.

        "document": "For the second Olympics in a row, the Indian men\u2019s hockey team will be contending for bronze after going down to world champions Germany in the semi-finals of the Paris 2024 Olympics on Tuesday. India, fifth in hockey rankings, took the early initiative and went ahead through Harmanpreet Singh\u2019s penalty corner (7\u2019) in the first quarter. However, World No. 2 Germany bounced back through Gonzalo Peillat (18\u2019) before Christopher Ruehr (27\u2019) gave them the lead. India, Tokyo 2020 bronze medallists, equalised through Sukhjeet Singh (36\u2019) but a Marco Miltkau goal (54\u2019) six minutes before the final hooter prevented India from making an appearance in the Olympics men\u2019s hockey final for the first time since Moscow 1980. India will take on Spain in the bronze medal match. World No. 8 Spain were blanked 4-0 by the Netherlands in their semi-final. At the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium in Colombes, India got off to a positive start and were awarded the first penalty corner of the match inside two minutes. Harmanpreet drew a save off opposition goalkeeper Jean-Paul Danneebrg before India\u2019s PR Sreejesh responded by making a save off Marco Miltkau. It was India in the remainder of the first quarter as they put reigning world champions Germany under pressure with strong attacking combinations. Harmanpreet Singh finally broke the deadlock inside seven minutes to put his side ahead. It was his eighth goal at Paris 2024 and the Indian captain leads the scoring charts. Germany began the second quarter in clinical fashion. Gonzalo Peillat scored from their first penalty corner to level proceedings at 1-1. India missed a golden chance with Abhishek failing to hit the target at the 20th-minute mark. Lalit Upadhyay also failed to convert a strong chance just three minutes later. Germany grew into the contest in the second quarter and were awarded a penalty stroke following a penalty corner. Christopher Ruehr went to the bottom left of Sreejesh\u2019s goal to help his side take a 2-1 lead three minutes before the half-time hooter. Barely a minute into the second half, Hardik Singh was inches away from levelling the tie after missing the post from a Harmanpreet penalty corner rebound. The Indian hockey team did restore parity when Sukhjeet Singh deflected Harmanpreet\u2019s penalty corner into the net. The remainder of the third quarter proved cagey as both sides chose caution over aggression. Just two minutes into the final quarter, Sanjay made a remarkable block on the goal line to keep India in the contest. The German hockey team dominated proceedings early in the quarter with the Indian defence tested on a number of occasions. Miltkau put Germany ahead with six minutes left after beating Sreejesh at the near post. India opting to sub off PR Sreejesh to bring on an extra attacker in search of the equaliser, faced a high-pressure situation from a penalty corner but managed to deal with it successfully. Sukhjeet Singh and Shamsher Singh missed crucial chances in the last minute and failed to force the match to a penalty shootout. India previously defeated Great Britain in the quarter-finals in a shootout to make the last four. India missed the services of defender Amit Rohidas in the semi-final after he received a one-match suspension for an offence in the match against Great Britain. With a brace from Rupinder Pal Singh and a goal from Simranjeet Singh, India had blanked Spain 3-0 in the group stage of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics en route to their bronze medal finish. India will play their Paris 2024 Olympics hockey bronze medal match at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium on Friday.",

Going for a staggering fifth title, Emma Hayes' side put in a resolute performance against Germany in Lyon. It was a far cry from their meeting just a week ago on 28 July, where the USA ran rampant in a 4-1 victory. For the second time this tournament, a 0-0 result at full-time meant they were forced into an extra 30 where, once again, the Americans were able to find the breakthrough. Mallory Swanson's threaded pass in behind the opposing backline was finished first time by Sophia Smith, who was able to poke the ball beyond the on-rushing Ann-Katrin Berger. Hayes' defense gave her side the foundation to go on and succeed in this game, with Naomi Girma in particular a rock at the back to keep the Germans at bay. Unwavering towards the end, with Germany throwing everything they had at the USA goal, Alyssa Naeher pulled off a game-winning stop by denying a headed effort with her foot. Their decorated manager now has the chance to bring home her first international title since taking the reins just over two months ago. It was the 37th meeting between these two sides, with the USWNT once more getting the better of their European opponents.

The trio of Roy van den Berg, Harrie Lavreysen and Jeffrey Hoogland rode faster than any trio in history, becoming the first team to ride 750m in less than 41 seconds. \u201cIt was awesome, it was like a home race, so many Dutch people here, it's close to the Netherlands,\u201d said Hoogland. \u201cThe track is nice, warm and fast, we were ready, everything was perfect, and then going under 41 seconds is amazing.\" Van den Berg got off to a flying start over the first 250m, nearly leaving his team-mates outside his draft. Nevertheless, Lavreysen caught it before the changeover, setting up an ideal second lap for the Dutch trio. Lavreysen put his powerful legs to use, gradually increasing his speed and building a larger gap for Hoogland to utilise in the final lap. Hoogland took over from Lavreysen at the 500m mark, speeding away to a world record and Olympic gold medal. \"When I crossed the line after two laps, I was searching for the time, and I saw the 28.8,\u201d said Lavreysen. \u201cThat was a record for the two of us, and I knew Jeff was under me, so I knew it was going to be crazy.\u201d He added: \u201cI was already smiling on my bike before he finished, and then I saw the under 41 time. That was crazy.\" Team GB couldn\u2019t match the sheer speed of the Netherlands, riding to the finish line in a time of 41.814 to claim the silver medal. Ed Lowe got off to an equally strong start as Van den Berg, but his team-mates rode outside his draft for much of the first lap. This created an uphill battle for Team GB, with Hamish Turnbull and Jack Carlin losing time to the Dutch trio. Still, they were more than pleased to finish with the silver medal. \"We know what we can do as a team. We had that in the tank if we executed well,\" said Carlin. \"It's not easy to come to your first Olympic Games. I'm really proud of the team. We surpassed what we wanted. We will enjoy that.\" Australia won a tight battle against hosts France in the bronze-medal match to claim the final spot on the podium with a time of 41.597. The Australian trio of Matthew Glaetzer, Leigh Hoffman and Matthew Richardson got off to an untidy start, but recovered to overpower the French trio of Florian Grengbo, Sebastien Vigier and Rayan Helal by the end of the second lap. \"It was a really hard one, and a challenging one,\" said Richardson. \"I could not even be prouder of the team that I am riding with and it shows the heart that we put into that final ride, switching it up last minute without any preparations.\" The crowd saluted the effort of the French riders, who raced to fourth in a time of 41.993 seconds.",

The 14-year-old relegated Tokyo 2020 silver medallist Hiraki Cocona of Japan from first place into second place in the standings after dropping into the bowl for the third and final time. Trew, wearing her trademark pink helmet, beamed as the winning score of 93.18 flashed onto the scoreboard before making a heart shape with her hands. World No.1 Cocona had to be content with the silver medal courtesy of her third-run score of 92.63, which pushed Sky Brown (92.31) of Great Britain back into bronze after a brief stay in second position for a repeat of their 2-3 podium finish from three years ago. Trew fell on her first run but made up for the slip-up on the second, moving into third place with a score of 90.11 heading into the deciding run. She then added a sprinkling of magic on her third attempt, producing an arsenal of tricks including 540s to send her to the top. Brown then improved her score for a brief stay in second position before Hiraki settled the podium positions with her run. Trew came into Paris 2024 among the favourites after winning the Olympic Qualifier Series events in Shanghai and Budapest. She announced herself on the global scene in 2023 becoming the first female athlete to land a 720 trick \u2013 which includes two mid-air rotations \u2013 in a competition when she was just 13. Trew added to her growing legend this year when she landed the first-ever female 900 which consists of two-and-a-half rotations.",

Playing at the Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille, the Boomers went down 95-90. Captain Patty Mills was decisive in the match and scored 26 points, including a two-pointer in the final seconds to force overtime. Josh Giddey also had a tremendous performance, scoring 25 points. However, world No. 4 Serbia, led by Nikola Jokic\u2019s 21 points beat the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallists in a tense and intensely-fought encounter. Australia, fifth in the basketball world rankings, took charge of the first quarter after Mills scored a two-pointer to get them on the scoreboard. Tying the score at 4-4 thanks to Giddey, Australia then matched 1980 Olympic champions Serbia point-for-point before taking a 21-17 lead with just over two minutes left in the first quarter. Mills proved decisive during this period of play and scored 10 points with two consecutive three-pointers to make it 31-17 for the Boomers. The 35-year-old Mills continued the onslaught in the second quarter and Australia were soon 39-17 up. However, Serbia, through Marko Guduric, mounted a comeback in the second half of the quarter and closed the gap down to 54-42 at the half-time break. Despite the Boomers maintaining a 10-point lead for most of the penultimate quarter, the Serbian basketball team kept pushing and Ognjen Dobric and Bogdan Bogdanovic helped them take the lead at 61-60. Australia were able to restore parity at 65-65 but Rio 2016 silver medallist Nikola Jokic ensured that Serbia closed the third quarter with a 67-65 advantage. Serbia surged to a 73-67 lead in the early stages of the final quarter but Jock Landale was successful in closing the gap down to just one point, making the final five minutes a nervy affair. With just three minutes left in the contest, Giddey made a three-pointer to level the scoreboard at 78-78. A late Vasilije Micic free throw complicated proceedings for Australia even more in the final seconds but captain Patty Mills pulled an incredible two-pointer with just two seconds left on the clock to level proceedings at 82-82 and force overtime. Serbia drew first blood in the overtime as Dobric scored a three-pointer but Jack McVeigh responded in kind to restore parity once more. Jokic restored the lead for Serbia and made it 93-90 before Bogdanovic netted two free throws to clinch the contest 95-90 and enter the semi-finals where they will face either Brazil or the United States of America.",

Instead of Diana Taurasi, Reeve inserted Jackie Young \u2014 and it paid off. The USA won 88-74, leading from start to finish at Bercy Arena in Paris on Wednesday, 7 August at Olympic Games Paris 2024. Young excelled, scoring 15 points while shooting 6/10 from the field. She also was important to the American win by being all over the court on defense and pushing the transition game. The United States had 23 points in fast breaks. \u201cShe's playing the way we want to play. Both ends of the floor and it's time to get to that space where we understand that if we don't win, we go home,\" Reeve said of Young after the game. \u201cShe's terrific. She gets the space that she wants to get to, she's persistent, plays the schemes, great help defender, great rotator, great rebounder. She does a lot of things well.\u201d Though Nigeria kept the score close in the first quarter, the American team\u2019s depth once again helped them stay on top throughout the game. Every player scored at least one point, with four players scoring in double digits. A\u2019ja Wilson once again had a double-double, scoring 20 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. She's now had a double-double in three out of the four USA games at Paris 2024.",

He won over the audience and, critically, the judges with his attacking style, keeping Nurbek Oralbay of Kazakhstan on the back foot for much of the bout. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d said the new Olympic champion. \u201cSince I was a boy I\u2019ve dreamed of being on this step of the podium.\u201d It was a dream come true for Khyzhniak, who proved to be a nightmare come to life for Oralbay. The Ukrainian boxer began throwing punches the minute the clock started on the first round. He utilized body shots, uppercuts, jabs and punches straight into the Kazakh boxer\u2019s defence to great effect, challenging his opponent early in the bout. Oralbay kept his nerve, however, sidestepping whenever possible and responding to Khyzhniak\u2019s attacks with ferocious blows of his own. It was an entertaining display of boxing that kept the crowd engaged in the match and cheering each time one of the boxers landed a punch. Even the judges couldn\u2019t settle on a dominant fighter after two rounds, giving one round to Khyzhniak and the other to Oralbay. Nonetheless, Khyzhniak\u2019s endless attacks would break Oralbay\u2019s resolve in the third and final round, with his uppercuts penetrating the Kazakh boxer\u2019s defence and his body shots landing with greater effect. Still, Oralbay held his own, staying in the bout until the final bell sounded, nosebleed and all. Despite the close score, there was no doubt about whose name would be called by the ring announcer at the end of the bout. Khyzhniak fell to his knees, humbled by his monumental achievement. \u201cSince getting the silver medal in Tokyo to this day, and finally getting the gold, I have worked so hard,\u201d said an elated Khyzhniak. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s a gold medal for Ukraine.\u201d Sweet redemption was his, as he overcame the disappointment of a silver medal at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 to win gold at Paris 2024. Oralbay settled for silver, with Cristian Javier Pinales of the Dominican Republic and Arlen Lopez Cardona of Cuba leaving with bronze medals after losing their semifinal bouts earlier in the competition.",

The javelin throw final starts at 11:55 PM IST and will be held at the Stade de France. Neeraj won the gold medal with an 87.58m throw at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. He also became only the second individual gold medal winner from India after Abhinav Bindra and the first from independent India to win an Olympic medal in athletics. Since then, he became a world champion, a Diamond League winner and successfully defended his Asian Games title. The 26-year-old will also feel confident about defending his Olympic title in Paris after outclassing the field and topping the qualification rounds with a monster 89.34m throw. It was the second-best throw of his career and Neeraj will be looking to match or even better that performance in the final. He is expected to face a tough challenge from Julian Weber of Germany, Anderson Peters of Grenada, Jakub Vadljech of Czechia and Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan. Meanwhile, the Indian hockey team will be looking to secure a second bronze medal in consecutive Olympics when they play Spain in the bronze medal match scheduled for 5:30 PM at the Yves du Manoir in Colombes today. India suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to reigning world champions Germany in the semi-final but can still bring back their 13th Olympic medal in Paris. India had previously blanked Spain 3-0 in the group stage of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics en route to the third-place finish. Indian freestyle wrestlers Aman Sehrawat and Anshu Malik will begin their Paris 2024 campaigns. While Aman will compete in men\u2019s 57kg, Anshu will be seen in action in the women\u2019s 57kg category. Both their bouts are scheduled to start from 2:30 PM. Jyothi Yarraji finished seventh in her women\u2019s 100m hurdles Round 1 heat with 13.16s on Wednesday and she will get another chance to qualify in the repechage round on Thursday. In the race, scheduled to begin at 2:05 PM, the national record holder needs to finish among the top two in her heat in order to make the semi-finals. The action continues in women\u2019s golf with Aditi Ashok and Diksha Dagar teeing up for round 2 at the Albatros course, Le Golf National just outside Paris. Aditi, who finished fourth at Tokyo 2020, is T13 after the first round. Diksha is T7 and will look to push on in the second round which gets underway at 12:30 PM.",

Cheers sounded out; the 21-year-old bounced on his toes in anticipation and with a final blessing from Tom Schaar, the Australian burst into life diving into the depths of the park bowl. It was the start of his victory lap. On a balmy Wednesday afternoon in Paris, Palmer had achieved what he had always set out to do: successfully defend his Olympic park title. In victory, he had become the second skateboarder to become a back-to-back Olympic champion, following the lead of Japan\u2019s Yuto Horigome in the men\u2019s street contest over a week ago. He did it too in some style, wrapping up the victory in his opening run effort of 93.11 with no skater able to better his proposition. USA\u2019s Schaar came closest with his 92.23 final run. Palmer, with the win in the bag, didn\u2019t complete his third and final attempt. About halfway through the time, the Australian bailed attempting a trick but he did waste a second longer to savour the moment. Climbing to the top of the vert volcano, the star of the afternoon\u2019s performance turned to the audience to properly receive his standing ovation. He bowed in gratitude before raising his board with his right hand, tugging out the Australian sigil with his left. The consummate showman had delivered again and they were all entertained.",

Sable, who clocked the national record of 8:09.91 in the same city last month, could not produce his best on the night and settled for 11th place with a time of 8:14.18 at the Stade de France. Morocco\u2019s Soufiane El Bakkali defended his crown with a season-best 8:06.05. He was followed by the USA\u2019s Kenneth Rooks (8:06.41) and Kenya\u2019s Abraham Kibiwot (8:06.47) on the podium. Ethiopia\u2019s Lamecha Girma, who holds the world record of 7:52.11 and is a Tokyo 2020 silver medal winner, suffered a fall and did not finish (DNF) the race. A total of 16 athletes competed in the final. Sable made a quick start and led the pack in the opening lap. However, he soon fell behind and was fourth at the 1000m mark and seventh by the end of the second lap. The Indian athlete fell further behind as Ethiopian runners and Soufiane El Bakkali jostled for the lead as the race progressed. Eventually, Sable finished over four seconds behind his own national record. Had Sable matched his national record of 8:09.91 in the race, it would have earned him an eighth place in the final. In the qualifying round, Sable clocked 8:15.43 to finish fifth in his heat and qualify for his first Olympic final. At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Sable failed to qualify after finishing seventh in his heats but was the fastest non-qualifier across all heats. For Paris 2024, Sable qualified by meeting the direct entry standard of 8:15.00. Meanwhile, the Indian duo of Pravin Chithravel and Abdulla Aboobacker could not qualify for the men\u2019s triple jump final. Chithravel logged a best of 16.25m on his second attempt to finish 12th in Group A and 27th overall.

Now, after an engaging day of action, the Netherlands and People\u2019s Republic of China will continue their quest for gold while Argentina and Belgium will battle it out for bronze. The Netherlands, who have a track record of success in the sport, comfortably beat Argentina by a final tally of 3-0 to advance to the final. The South Americans had more shots than their counterparts, but were unable to convert these opportunities. The Dutch scored two of their three goals in the second quarter before tacking on another in the third quarter. Goals were scored by Luna Noa Fokke, Laura Nunnink and Yibbi Jansen. Beginning at Athens 2004, the Netherlands' women have now advanced to the hockey final of every Games for the last 20 years. They are the most successful nation in the sport, taking home nine medals since it was opened up to women in 1980. Four of these medals are gold and they will look to add to their collection in the coming days. They most recently won gold at Tokyo 2020, beating Argentina in the final. The second semi-final of the day was a thriller, with the People\u2019s Republic of China beating Belgium in a shoot-out, 3-2, after finishing regulation in a 1-1 draw. Zou Meirong opened the scoring for People\u2019s Republic of China with an 18th minute goal, which remained the match\u2019s only score until the final minute.

        "document": "Hou Zhihui of the People's Republic of China defended her Olympic title in dramatic fashion at the South Paris Arena on Wednesday, 7 August, setting an Olympic record in the clean-and-jerk to secure the gold medal in women\u2019s 49kg weight class of weightlifting at the Olympic Games Paris 2024. It was a sensational victory that won her copious applause from the audience and joyous praise from her coaches. Hou lifted her arms in triumph, celebrating what she had just accomplished and reflecting on how she got there. \u201cBefore my final lift, I thought about my family, my team here and my country all backing me up,\u201d said Hou. \u201cThat\u2019s what motivated me to make it happen on the final lift. I was really relieved after the final lift that broke the Olympic record.\u201d It was a tense two hours at the South Paris Arena, as athletes faltered and triumphed in successive lifts. Romania's Mihaela Valentina Cambei set herself up as the woman to beat in the women\u2019s 49kg weight category, completing a electrifying series of lifts that saw her raise 93kg above her head to take the lead at the halfway mark of the event. While Cambei was untouchable in the snatch, her rivals sensed an opportunity in the clean-and-jerk when she entered the competition at lower weight than the other medal favorites. The Romanian lifter entered the clean-and-jerk at 106kg, while Thailand\u2019s Surodchana Khambao entered the competition at 110kg, along with future gold medalist Hou, with India\u2019s Mirabai Chanu Saikhom looking to make a statement by entering at 111kg. Cambei\u2019s decision to start with lower weights paid dividends, however, as she lifted 112kg in the clean-and-jerk to post a final total of 205kg. It was a tall order for her rivals, who began to falter after successfully lifting their entry weights. Saikhom missed her attempt to lift 114kg, removing her from medal contention. Khambao managed to match Cambei\u2019s clean-and-jerk score of 112kg, but couldn\u2019t lift 114kg to improve her final total, leaving her at a total of 200kg to claim the bronze medal. This meant only Hou could challenge Cambei for the gold medal. She went for broke, increasing the weight to 117kg for her second of three attempts in the clean-and-jerk. She failed, meaning she would have one more try to lift 117kg, with the gold medal going to Cambei if she failed. Hou would not be defeated by the bar that brought her endless joy three years prior at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. She summoned all her strength, hoisting the 117kg bar above her head to set the Olympic record in the clean-and-jerk and claim the gold medal with a total of 206kg. \u201cI was really, really determined to make it happen for the final attempt because I knew that, if I missed it, I couldn\u2019t win gold,\u201d explained Hou. \u201cI just tried to put in the maximum performance.\u201d An overjoyed Hou was joined on the podium by Cambei and Khambao, closing the final chapter of a dramatic competition at Paris 2024.",

The last time Kennedy won a pole vault competition she shared the spoils with defending Olympic champion Katie Moon of the United States. At last year\u2019s world championships in Budapest, Kennedy and Moon agreed to share the title after both had reached 4.90m. But the 27-year-old Kennedy made sure she had sole ownership of the Olympic gold as the only vaulter to clear 4.90m. Moon had to be content with silver on countback at 4.85m with Canada\u2019s Alysha Newman setting a national record at the same height. Kennedy hardly skipped a beat on her triumphant night with a missed attempt at 4.70m a minor blemish en route to gold. She sailed over the bar on the first attempt at heights of 4.80m, 4.85m and 4.90m. Moon missed at 4.90m and asked to pass on her second attempt at this height before two failures at 4.95m to settle for silver.

On Wednesday 7 August, cheered on by a capacity crowd the the Stade de France, Team USA\u2019s Quincy Hall raced to a brilliant gold medal in the Paris 2024 men\u2019s 400m to the surprise of many \u2014 but not his own. \"I told you guys I was going to get a gold medal this year and I guess I just showed you I did it,\" an ecstatic Hall said after the race, \"I know I can win. I knew it today. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing my whole career.\" The US star posted a time of 43.40 to claim the Olympic title ahead of Matthew Hudson-Smith of Great Britain, who won silver in 43.44 and Zambia\u2019s Muzala Samukonga who won bronze in 43.74. Hall had entered these Olympics as the US trials winner and ranked number one in the world. However, the fastest time of the year belonged to Britain's Hudson-Smith with a resurgent London 2012 gold medallist Kirani James of Grenada the second-fastest man on the start line. Yet if there's anything that's become clear during this rollercoaster of a ride of an athletics competition at Paris 2024, it's that past times \u2014 and reputations \u2014 mean little in the pressure cooker of an Olympic final. Courage, determination and the ability to fly when others falter can take you all the way to Olympic gold. Hall demonstrated all of those qualities in abundance. \"I don\u2019t give up,\" Hall continued. \"I just grit, I grind. I\u2019ve got determination. Anything I think will get me to that line, I think of it. A lot of hurt, a lot of pain. \"I just won. It\u2019s over. For the next four years, I can say I\u2019m an Olympic champion.\" After a clean start, Hudson-Smith had caught and passed Hall by around the 200m mark and looked like he was on his way to gold as he bounded confidently into the final straight. However, against the backdrop of gasps from the crowd, the 27-year-old Hall somehow found the strength to fight back. As his British rival faded, the new Olympic champion pounced on his opportunity, passing the line first to win a thrilling Olympic medal race. It says much about the quality of this final that the third and fourth-placed finishers, Sumukonga and Trinidad and Tobago's Jereem Richards both set new national records, while Hudson-Smith broke the European record en route to silver. For Hall, this was the fastest time he had ever recorded and a testament to just how good he needed to be to earn the title of Olympic champion.",

Vinesh Phogat made it to the final in the women\u2019s 50kg division on Tuesday but was disqualified after she failed the weigh-in on Wednesday. Reetika Hooda, in the women\u2019s 76kg division, starts her campaign on Saturday.",

But here in Europe, they broke new ground and rewrote the history books. While their quest for gold was stunted in a semi-final defeat by Spain, the African nation still had a chance at making the podium. And that is exactly what they did, winning a first-ever Olympic medal in style as they picked apart Egypt in a thumping 6-0 victory. Abde Ezzalzouli opened the scoring just after the 20-minute mark before Soufiane Rahimi doubled their advantage just moments later with his seventh goal of the tournament. Bilal El Khannouss added a third soon after the interval before Rahimi completed his brace. And just in case there was any doubt, a fifth from Akram Nakach sealed their place on the podium late on. Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi wanted in on the action too, curling home a pinpoint free-kick to emphasise just how thrilling this side have been. Morocco is very much a nation on the rise, and this emphatic bronze is just the start for them.",

Lo edged ahead 5-2 before the refugee fighter landed another body blow. Al Gothany then conceded two penalty points, or gam-jeom, before Lo ended the contest with three kicks to the head to win the second round and the bout.

Spain took the lead through captain Marc Miralles (18\u2019) but India struck right back through a brace by skipper Harmanpreet Singh (30\u2019, 33\u2019). The victory at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium saw India secure a record-extending 13th medal in hockey at the Olympics and the second bronze in successive editions. India, in fact, won successive medals in hockey for the first time since Munich 1972, played 52 years ago. \"I feel great,\" India hockey captain Harmanpreet Singh said. \"We create history again, back-to-back (bronze medals). It's a big day for India and a big day for hockey. \"Today's game was very good. We played as a team. Everyone delivered, especially our legend Sreejesh. It was his last game. It's a memorable game for him, and a big achievement as a team.\" Heading into Paris 2024, India were the most successful hockey team in Olympic history with eight gold, one silver and three bronze medals. At Tokyo 2020, the team had broken a 41-year-long medal drought by capturing a historic bronze. Up against world No. 8 Spain, who upset defending champions Belgium in the quarter-finals, the Indian team, fifth in hockey rankings, began cautiously but slowly grew into the game as it progressed. From the midway stage of the opening quarter, the Indian hockey team started to launch meaningful forays in the Spanish attacking third but failed to create any clear cut chances. Spain, meanwhile, could only manage a couple of circle penetrations throughout the opening quarter compared to India\u2019s nine. A couple of minutes into the second quarter, though, it was Spain who took the lead through a penalty stroke. Manpreet Singh\u2019s infringement inside the circle saw the referee point towards the spot and Marc Miralles stepped up to blaze one in the top corner past PR Sreejesh. The Spain men\u2019s hockey team, looking for their first Olympic medal since a silver at Beijing 2008, got an opportunity to double their advantage as they were awarded two penalty corners shortly after the opening goal. However, some fantastic rushing by Amit Rohidas, back in the Indian playing line-up after serving a suspension in the semi-finals against Germany, kept the Spanish charge at bay. Borja Lacalle thought he had Sreejesh beat for the second time in the match but his shot came out off the post and the Indian goalkeeper ensured the resulting penalty corner stayed out. With less than 15 seconds left for the first-half hooter, India equalised as Harmanpreet Singh successfully converted a penalty corner to register his ninth goal of Paris 2024 and consolidated his position as the top scorer in the tournament. Harmanpreet drag flicked in his second of the match minutes after the half-time break to give the Indian hockey team the lead for the first time in the match. The Indian skipper had a crack at a hat-trick, again from a penalty corner, shortly after but this time, was thwarted by Spanish custodian Luis Calzado. Spain managed to get the ball in the Indian net with five minutes to go in the third quarter as Joaquin Menini bundled it in after pouncing on a loose ball following Sreejesh\u2019s fantastic save to keep out Jose Basterra\u2019s penalty corner attempt. However, the goal was disallowed as replays showed that the ball had come off a Spanish body in the phase of play. At the other end, Calzado denied India and Harmanpreet again from another penalty corner to keep the difference between the two teams to just one goal heading into the final quarter. The fourth period turned out to be a feisty affair with both teams getting stuck in. As Spain pushed up in search of the all-important equaliser, the Indian backline had to soak in long spells of pressure to see off the win. PR Sreejesh contributed to the win with two gutsy saves in the final two minutes of his storied international hockey career.",

Before switching her allegiance to Australia in 2019, Cikamatana, then of Fiji, had clinched the women\u2019s 90kg title at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Bruce and Nichele, meanwhile, will lift in the men\u2019s 89kg and women\u2019s 71kg events, respectively. Bruce holds the Australian records in his division with 150kg in snatch, 190kg in clean and jerk, and 338kg total. The Blacktown-based weightlifter bagged the men\u2019s 81kg silver on his Commonwealth Games debut in 2022. The 24-year-old Nichele is a Commonwealth Championships gold medallist from 2023. Weightlifting at the Paris 2024 Olympics will be conducted at the South Paris Arena. While the competition will be conducted between August 7 and August 11, Australian weightlifters will feature only on the final three days. Weightlifting made its Olympic debut in 1896 but Australia first competed in the discipline at the London 1948 Olympics. Vern Barberis\u2019 bronze in the lightweight category four years later was their first medal. At Los Angeles 1984, 32 years after their first medal, Dean Lukin won the gold medal in the super heavyweight division while Robert Kabbas claimed silver as a light heavyweight. Australia\u2019s fourth and latest Olympic weightlifting medal, a bronze, was won by Stefan Botev in the super heavyweight category at Atlanta 1996.",

Gunn and Dunne are set to be Australia\u2019s first-ever breaking Olympians. B-Girl Rachael Gunn, a 36-year-old university lecturer from Sydney, who goes by the name Raygun while performing, is Australia\u2019s top-ranked B-Girl and has represented Australia at the past three World Championships. B-Boy Jeff Dunne, going by J-Attack, is a 16-year-old from New South Wales who trains up to six hours every day in order to improve his style and movement. Both Gunn and Dunne secured Paris 2024 Olympic quotas by winning the Oceania Breaking Championships in Sydney last year before being officially announced by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC). Breaking combines urban dance with athleticism and athletes get judged on their creativity, personality, technique, variety, performance, as well as musicality. Breaking battles have an MC and DJ \u2013 unlike other dance or routines that are practiced to set music, breakers don\u2019t know what music they will be performing to, with how they adapt and weave their skills into the tracks a key part of their scoring. It is the first dancesport discipline to be included in the official Olympic programme and breaking will be making its Olympic debut at Paris 2024. It appeared at the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires in 2018. Events will be held at the Place de la Concorde and 32 athletes (16 b-boys and 16 b-girls) will face each other in 1v1 single battles.",

He finished eighth in the second heat of the men\u2019s 800m repechage in 1:50.11 behind Mexico's Jesus Tonatiu Lopez, who progressed to the semi-finals. Swiss-based Sudanese-born runner Suliman made his Olympic debut in the heats the previous day [7 August] clocking 1:49.61 from his heat. Despite failing to lower his personal best of 1:48.77, the runner hopes to build on this Olympic experience and further his running career that only took off three years ago. He moved to Bern in 2021 from Egypt, where he fled with his family as war ravaged his home country, and initially joined a football club. But running later became a solace for the 20-year-old who had to work for most of his teenage life to help support his family. \u201cIt was only through running that I found myself,\u201d he told the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. \u201cSport helps me to overcome challenges. Thanks to it, I can integrate more easily, learn German and meet people.\u201d Musa hopes to continue being an inspiration to millions of displaced people as he chases his track dreams. \u201cDon't listen to people who tell you that you can't do it. Just keep going, the rewards will come.\u201d",

        "document": "The Paris 2024 canoe sprint race saw Liu Hao and Ji Bowen from the People's Republic of China top the Olympic podium in the men's C-2 500m. Gabriele Casadei and Carlo Tacchini of Italy took the silver while Spain\u2019s Joan Antoni Moreno and Diego Dominguez clinched bronze in a photo finish. The Chinese duo delivered a flawless performance in the men\u2019s C-2 500m canoe sprint at the Paris 2024 Games, capturing the gold medal with a time of 1:39.48. But for Liu, the victory was more than just a medal \u2014 it was redemption. \u201cIn Tokyo, I took two silver medals, so winning the gold means a lot to me and is very important for my country as well. It\u2019s compensation for what I\u2019ve done up until now. I always believe I have the power to win,\u201d Liu said. The 2021 Olympics had left him hungry, and this triumph quenched that thirst in the most spectacular fashion. From the moment the starting signal blared, Liu and Ji were in a league of their own. Their boat surged forward with a blend of power and grace that left their competitors trailing in their wake. By the halfway point, they were nearly two seconds ahead of the field \u2014 a margin that in the world of sprint canoeing is as decisive as it gets. Liu, the elder of the pair at 30, drew from his vast experience, while Ji, just 23, brought youthful energy and a burning desire to prove himself. \"He is very young and motivated; he will be the future of China,\" Liu said of his partner. Behind them, the race for the remaining podium spots was a fierce and tightly contested battle. Italy\u2019s Casadei and Tacchini, who had finished seventh at last year\u2019s World Championships, found redemption of their own. As they crossed the finish line in 1:41.08, securing the silver, their joy was palpable. \u201cThe Olympics is the biggest competition, so coming home with a medal is always satisfying,\u201d Tacchini remarked. Despite the challenging conditions on the water - \u201cthere were a lot of waves for some reason,\u201d Tacchini noted - they managed to stay composed and focused, edging out Spain by just a tenth of a second. The Spanish duo of Moreno and Dominguez experienced a rollercoaster of emotions in the final seconds of the race. Initially, it seemed that Hungary had pipped them to the bronze, but a closer review revealed that it was, in fact, Spain who had secured the final spot on the podium. \u201cWhen our name was showing on the screens, it was an explosion of emotions,\u201d Dominguez said. The bronze medal was a moment of vindication for the pair, who had poured their hearts into their preparation. \u201cWe gave everything and we were rewarded with a medal. This is the greatest thing ever,\u201d Moreno added.",

The France vs Spain football match in the Paris 2024 Olympics men\u2019s final will be available on live streaming and on TV in Australia. The FRA vs ESP soccer match will take place at the Parc des Princes and will begin at 2:00 AM AEST on Saturday. France, Olympic champions at Los Angeles 1984, are arriving in the final after beating Egypt 3-1 in extra time. Les Bleus went behind to a Mahmoud Saber goal in the second half before Jean-Phillippe Mateta scored seven minutes before the end to restore parity and force extra-time. Mateta grabbed his second goal of the night to put France ahead nine minutes into extra time while Michael Olise scored in the 108th minute to confirm their final berth. Les Bleus will enjoy overwhelming support in front of home fans at the Stade de France in search of their third Olympic men\u2019s football medal. They had also won the silver medal at Paris 1900. On that occasion, however, only two matches were held with Great Britain winning the gold. France had previously beaten Argentina in a fiercely-contested quarter-final with Mateta scoring in the fifth minute. They won all three group-stage fixtures against the United States of America, New Zealand and Guinea before advancing to the knockout rounds. Meanwhile, Spain, winners on home soil at Barcelona 1992, are arriving into the final after beating Morocco 2-1 in the semis. Like France, Spain also had to come from behind after conceding a penalty from Soufiane Rahimi in the first half. Youngster Fermin Lopez brought them level with a superb strike before Juanlu Sanchez secured victory just five minutes before the end of the match. La Roja have also finished runners-up thrice and this will be their second consecutive Olympic men\u2019s football final. They had lost 2-1 to Brazil in the men\u2019s gold medal match at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Spain blanked Japan 3-0 in the quarter-finals with a brace from Fermin while Abel Ruiz also got on the scoresheet. Their only loss at Paris 2024 came against Egypt in the group stage. A brace from Ibrahim Adel saw Spain suffer a 2-1 loss.",

We did it with purpose, we made it.\u201d The medal race was initially scheduled for Wednesday but was pushed back 24 hours because of a lack of wind. \"Yesterday I was so tired, it was very hot, we waited for two hours in the water,\" Banti explained. \"I think we recovered well and this morning we were ready to go out and do our best medal race.\" Argentina\u2019s Mateo Majdalani and Eugenia Bosco won silver, their nation\u2019s first medal in the event in eight years, as Micah Wilkinson and Erica Dawson earned New Zealand their first medal in the event after crossing the line to take bronze. \"I think we probably had one of the best weeks in our sailing careers, both of us,\" an emotional Majdalani told reporters. \"We sailed at a level we\u2019ve never done, in this week, so it\u2019s amazing.\" The New Zealand pair finished ahead of John Gimson and Anna Burnet of Great Britain, who were punished in the medal race for being on the wrong side of the starting line and finished fourth overall.
