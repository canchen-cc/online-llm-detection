Critics fear this could lead to some proposed schemes getting the axe, jeopardizing the nation's renewable energy targets. While the government insists it remains committed to wind power, the new guidelines introduce stricter planning regulations, essentially granting more power to local communities to veto projects. Proponents argue this encourages local engagement and addresses concerns about visual impact and noise pollution. However, opponents believe the move prioritizes fossil fuels and undermines the UK's position as a leader in renewable energy. With the urgency of climate change, many fear these changes will stifle investment and innovation in a vital sector.
